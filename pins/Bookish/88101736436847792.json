      "description": "Primo Michele Levi was an Italian Jewish chemist and writer \"If This Is a Man\", his account of the year he spent as a prisoner in the Auschwitz concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Poland. It was really a study on how you survived and who didn't, almost a psychological, physical and emotional survivor study. It's a fascinating book.",
