      "description": "When living with a chronic illness, the feeling of \"No one gets it!\" can shift from an occasional frustration to a constant grievance, steering one's spiritual walk onto shaky ground. In Why Can't I Make People Understand?, Lisa Copen, founder of rest Ministries, provides unique insight into why people crave the understanding of those around them when they are suffering w/ a chronic condition. This book reveals & addresses the hidden aggravations many chronically ill people deal with.",
