      "description": "Sarah's Key. I have read the book just waiting for the DVD to arrive. Haunting, devastating story of the round up of Parisian Jews by French police in WW2. Taken to the Vel d'hiv and kept in inhumane conditions before being sent to the concentration camps. When I say I enjoyed the book that is completely the wrong word, but it was a real eye opener that this true account of what happened to the Jews of Paris is not widely known. Be prepared for tears and anger",
