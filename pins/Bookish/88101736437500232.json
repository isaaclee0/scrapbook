      "description": "My mom recommended this book. It is Immaculee Ilibagiza's experience during the Rwandan massacre in the 90's. I was young at the time and reading this book allowed me to learn about this tragic event in our world's history. Most importantly, it is a true testament of God's sovereignty and ultimate love for us. Even in the worst of times, we can rejoice and praise the One who gave us life.",
