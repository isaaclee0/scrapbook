      "description": "In the darkest era of human history Hitler’s plan to rid the world of Jews and ‘undesirables’ led to the slaughter of millions of innocent people. Paulette Mahurin tells the story of one woman who lived through it. Helen Stein sees her family torn apart and finds herself thrown into the hell that is Auschwitz. Here she endures shocking indignities at the hands of the SS, but also encounters compassion, kindness and friendship.",
