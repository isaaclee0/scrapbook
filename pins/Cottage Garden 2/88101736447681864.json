The house is still quiet, the birds are singing and it's just me, the dogs and a cup of hot tea walking around, getting our feet wet in the grass still heavy with dew. This is the moment to take stock, to plan the day ahead, to breathe deeply. The day begins here. #mygarden #countryliving #morning #sharonsantoni #myfrenchcountryhome",
