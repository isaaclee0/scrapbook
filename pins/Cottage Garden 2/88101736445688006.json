      "description": "â™¡ Wow this almost looks like my home in England, it was on Pimlico Farm, we had 1 side which looking at this would be on the left here was a townhouse. The farm road was right  outside my kitchen door. I could look across the road and see all the baby sheep there. My landlords were so nice. It was a beautiful area. I could also see RAF Croughton where I used to catch the bus to RAF Heyford where I worked as head cook at the NCO Club.",
