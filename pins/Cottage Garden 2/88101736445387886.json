      "description": "Climbing roses and clematis are perfect companions. They happily share the same arch or trellis, both reaching for the sun. They have the same natural needs, require the same growing conditions and benefit from the same fertilizers. They often are of similar sizes with the result that neither swamps the other. They also complement one another. When combined they often look many times more beautiful than on a standalone basis",
