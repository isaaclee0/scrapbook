      "description": "Prairie Smoke. Geum triflorum. A distinctive prairie plant that produces feathery plumes giving the flowerheads a wispy, smokey appearance. The flowerheads are reddish-purple in in color and never appear to be entirely open but are easily pollinated by early spring insects. The leaves are fern-like and hairy and grow in clumps from the rootstock. It is a hardy cool season (blooms mid to late spring) plant from the rose family that can be grown in full sun to partial shade.",
