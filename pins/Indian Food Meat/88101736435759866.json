      "description": "A mouth watering Pakistani dish with many exotic spices. The fresh tasting dish is called 'Chicken Jalfrezi'. The roughly chopped onions, diced tomatoes, ground Coriander, Garam Masala and most importantly tender marinated Chicken (just to name a few ingredients). Garnished with long slices of Green Chilli delivers a Spicy-Tangy taste.  Paired with with some hot homemade roti makes it a PERFECT Meal.   Prepared by Saba A. Rehman",
