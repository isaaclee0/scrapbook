      "description": "I cannot rave enough about today's recipe. Outright delicious! Chicken and methi complement each other really well and I'm eternally grateful to the origins of this recipe. The key to this recipe is in the caramalized onions that are pureed along with curd forming the base of this creamy dish. An ideal do-ahead lunch/dinner party fare.",
