      "description": "Gordon Ramsayâ€™s butter chicken recipe is so easy to make at home and tastes delicious too. This classic Indian dish will take around 50 mins to prepare and cook but is best made in advance so the chicken has plenty of time to marinade in the homemade butter-based curry sauce. This butter chicken recipe is great for sharing with friends and family, especially on a Friday after a busy week so you can catch up over a delicious meal. #gordonramsay #gordonramsa #chickenrecipe",
