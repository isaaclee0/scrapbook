      "description": "Georgian design and architecture is highly cherished in the U.K. since the proportions are so harmonious and relate to the human scale. The same ideas now exist in buildings all over the world, especially in those of the Georgian period in New England and of the Shaker movement. This is why our style works well in traditional as well as more modern buildings.",
