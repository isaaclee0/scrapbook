      "description": "David Austin rose Tess of the d'Urbervilles. bears large, bright crimson blooms. They are beautifully formed; deeply cupped with loosely packed petals intertwined at the centre of each bloom. The petals eventually turn back to give a domed, less formal, but still attractive, flower. They bend over with their weight, to give an elegant effect. There is a pleasing Old Rose fragrance.",
