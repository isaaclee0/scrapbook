      "description": " \n\nInside and out…this is my current morning view and I’m obsessed! I didn’t think our climbing roses could get any more beautiful but this morning they are just stunning! I love seeing them hanging around the edge of our Dutch door. \n\n⁣\n\nFor those of you who want details, these are Eden climbing roses and we planted them four years ago. ⁣\n\n⁣\n\nThis space is perfect for family gatherings or just spending the morning with your coffee outside.\n\n",
