      "description": "White and pink garden roses can be in place of peonies. Like peonies, garden roses are available in a variety of pastel and coral hues. They also have \"almost identical petals that mirror the peony's iconic 'powder-puff' petal,\" says Eric Buterbaugh, celebrity florist and Chief Floral Designer of The Bouqs.
