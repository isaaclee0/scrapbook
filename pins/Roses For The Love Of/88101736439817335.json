      "description": "Propagate Roses - Cut 8 to 9 inches of a long stem rose at 45-degree angle. Remove spent blooms, leaves, or rose hips. Dip stem in cinnamon. Take a potato, remove any \"eyes\". Cut it in half and bore a hollow for rose stem. Plant about 4 inches into the ground or pot with moist soil. Cover with a glass jar. Planting on the north side will give the roses soft morning sun. Water to keep the soil moist, but do not soak soil. Transplant in about two months. loved and pinned by http://omved.com/",
