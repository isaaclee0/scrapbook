      "description": "Amazing Graceâ„¢, From Scotland we bring you a most outstanding continual blooming rose.The fragrance is magnificent and wonderfully rich, much like an expensive Parisian perfume. The huge 7\", 80+ petaled blooms have an old-fashioned look and quartered centers. The color is a blend of soft pink and cream. The rose has everything: strong fragrance, beautiful blooms and wonderful foliage. Makes a good cut flower.",
