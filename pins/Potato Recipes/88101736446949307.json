      "description": "This classic potato dish with its glorious caramelised top and rich, melting interior will always be one of Hugh's favourites. Something magical happens when you bake potatoes, thinly sliced, in garlic-scented cream. Hugh tends to use whichever floury variety he has to hand, but you can also make it with large, new potatoes. The texture is a bit different but still very good. He loves a dauphinoise with a green salad and plain-cooked Puy lentils.",
