      "description": "These authentic slow roasted Greek lemon potatoes are packed with delicious fresh zesty flavors of lemon, garlic, and oregano. They are so easy to make and are the perfect side dish for so many meals. An authentic greek recipe - the potatoes are cooked in broth, extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and oregano. The potatoes suck up all those flavors, to give you a potato that is amazingly tender on the inside, slightly crispy on the outside and so full of flavor!",
