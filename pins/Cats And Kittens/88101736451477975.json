      "description": "... Katzecure fencing, I had it fitted about a year ago. It looks smart and the cats just can't get over it, they have tried but once they reach the poles they just can't get over. I've seen a couple of local cats sitting on the top of the fencing looking in but as soon as they touch the poles they roll so they don't venture in. 2 of my neighbours have had it fitted as well and we are alll very happy with it.",
