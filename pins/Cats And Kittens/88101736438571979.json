      "description": "Malaysia - In 2005, a poor cat 'stole' fish from a restaurant and as 'punishment', the appallingly cruel owner of the restaurant, cut off his two front legs. Hero was left there - unable to move. A couple, Maria and Harey found the cat and took him home. They took care of him, adopted him and taught him how to walk on two paws. They named him \"Hero\".
