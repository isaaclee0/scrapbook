      "description": "I built an outdoor cat enclosure after one of my cats was diagnosed with gallstones. They were indoor-outdoor cats for a few years, but I had long wanted to build them something like this that keeps them closer  to home and allows them to enjoy the fresh air and sun. I think next Spring I may plant around it to give them a little extra interest.",
