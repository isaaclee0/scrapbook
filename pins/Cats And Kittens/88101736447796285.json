Friends of BCAS knows the only way to stop the killing of cats at our shelter is to prevent new litters. Starting in February, spay/neuter of community/feral cats is free and pet cats only $20. This is for Burlington County residents only.  Visit our spay/neuter webpage to make an appointment. Friends also provides assistance to trap-neuter-return community cats you feed. IF YOU FEED THEM, FIX THEM.",
