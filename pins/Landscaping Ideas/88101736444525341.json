      "description": "To stop our digging dog from killing the beds against the house, and even in their kenneling area where there is gravel.  Simply layer chicken wire under the bark or gravel and you have a much more effective barrier to thwart the digging monster hidden in your dog. Wish there were a better way since flowers might be nice to plant but unfortunately my dog hates flowers too.",
