      "description": "pleaching-britt-dyer-2-gardenista. How do I train pleached trees? When trees are young, thin branches are flexible and can be bent and tied against a trellis or frame. Cut off any branches that don’t want to bend. Weave together supple young shoots and tie them onto the framework with twine. Don’t force branches that don’t want to bend. It is better to cut them off and wait for more shoots.",
