      "description": "Seafood Curry (Malaysian Indian-Style) recipe - For my US readers, you might be more familiar with Thai or Indian curries offered here at Thai or Indian restaurants. Malaysian curries are quite different. Unlike Thai curries, Malaysian curries are not sweet because coconut milk is used sparingly to complement the spices but not overshadow their tastes. #malaysian #curry #seafood",
