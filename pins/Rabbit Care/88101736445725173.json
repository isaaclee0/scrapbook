      "description": "This was super easy to build.  It took the weekend to construct.   Cost under $100.00.  The litter box and hay is under the shelf.   The top left portion lifts off making it easy to feed and pet your rabbits.  The lower door opens down to pull out the litter box for cleaning. I had it open up before as you see in the picture, but you had to  crawl under to grip the litter box and place hay. I have since added a ramp for them.  I have added 3 more pictures but can't link them yet to this pic.",
