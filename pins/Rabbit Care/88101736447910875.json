      "description": "House bunny area consists of... Litter trays, fresh hay feeding area, chew toys, comfy sleeping area, & near a patio door so they can see outside.  Also provide a hideout - somewhere for them to run into to feel safe. The hideout is behind the couch for these bunnies.  Mats attached with cable ties to a puppy pen, protect wallpaper.   These bunnies have the run of the house, but they enjoy staying in their own little area most of the time - which is very important for house bunnies to have.",
