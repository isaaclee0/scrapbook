      "description": "Improvements: bury the barrel up to 6 inches from top, fill the barrel halfway with dirt and straw. Create multiple short tunnels leading in and between the barrels then lightly fill each with dirt so that the does can dig around and feel like they are creating their own nests. Cover the tops of each barrel with a removable rabbit friendly flower bed so that it looks and feels like a real warren. (This could be fun for our pet rabbits.)",
