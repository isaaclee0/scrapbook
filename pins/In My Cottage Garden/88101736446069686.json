      "description": "Rosmarinus officinalis, rosemary. Aromatic, dark green, narrow leaves provide interest throughout the year and can be added to a multitude of dishes to enhance the flavour. From mid-spring to early summer (and often again in autumn), lilac-blue to white flowers appear towards the ends of the stems. Ideal for adding structure to the herb garden, it will thrive in a warm, sunny position in well drained soil.",
