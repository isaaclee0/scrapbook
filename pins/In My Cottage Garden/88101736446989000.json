      "description": "'Cecile Brunner': the 'Sweetheart Rose'(USA), a small, repeat- blooming Polyantha hybridized in 1881 by Pernet- Ducher. The climbing 'Cecile Brunner', actually named \"Bloomfield Abundance,\" can be distinguished by examining the sepals, as one sepal usually extends itself into a small leaf. Cecile Brunner was the daughter of M.Ulrich Brunner, a rose-grower of Lausanne. The full name is actually \"Mlle. Cecile Brunner\" , never Cecil, as some people persist in calling her.",
