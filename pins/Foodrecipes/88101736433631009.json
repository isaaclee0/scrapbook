      "description": "I had forgotten how much I loved this dish.  From the 1972 Southern Living Party Cookbook.  I was only in my mid-twenties when I decided I was going to tackle this Italian dish and it was quite the challenge for this young mother of two,  I kept thinking to myself, what if I mess this up, I have no grocery money left! Although I didn't cook the flour taste out I was quite proud of myself! I have fixed it many time since and it turns out beautifully every time!!",
