      "description": "For both low maintenance and aesthetic appeal, a brick pathway is the perfect choice for your landscape. To make the walkway more in tune with nature, avoid using perfectly straight lines, seen here with the path curving around the stairs. Framing the walkway with low, small shrubs adds a personal touch that gives the path a completed look. Using similar colors for both the brick walkway and the rock that surrounds the landscape integrates the path into the garden./",
