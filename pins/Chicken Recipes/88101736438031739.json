      "description": "Spinach Dip Stuffed Chicken Breast - made my own Cajun seasoning (1 tbsp smoked paprika, cayenne, oregano, garlic, black pepper and 2 tbsp sea salt and chopped scallions. Dash of basil and thyme). Also used swiss instead of jack, goat cheese and Greek yogurt (4 oz each) instead of cream cheese, and added 1 can of artichokes. Served with garlic spinach quinoa. Delicious success and healthier than you'd expect!",
