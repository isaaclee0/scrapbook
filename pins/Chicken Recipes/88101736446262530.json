      "description": "Martha Stewart's Chicken Fricassee .. A fricassee is halfway between a saute and a stew. A true classic -- with as many variations as there are grandmothers in France -- it relies on humble ingredients and just a single pot. It's the original French comfort food: simmered chicken with hearty vegetables in a rich, silky sauce. And almost as satisfying as the dish itself is having our one-pot master recipe in your repertoire.",
