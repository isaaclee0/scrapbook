      "description": "Oven Baked Chicken Fajitas. These are fabulous!! I changed the recipe a bit to simplify it and suit my taste. For mine I did the following: two bell peppers, half of a large onion, and chicken breasts- all cut into strips- place in a greased 9x13. Mix 2 tbsp of oil with a packet of oretega fajita seasoning and a shake each of chipotle powder and chili powder. Pour the mixture over the chicken and veggies, stir to coat, and bake at 400 for 20-30 mins or until veggies are done to your liking.",
