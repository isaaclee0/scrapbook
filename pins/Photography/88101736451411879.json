      "description": "This photo was published in 'Picture Post Britain' by Gavin Weightman. The book is about Britiain in the 1930s, 40s and 50s. Everyone who sees this photo seems to think the woman looks like me, my own mother even thought it was me! Sadly there was no information about this photo in the book. Does anyone know more about this lovely lady? Update, thanks to topcat-angel TEA-SY DOES IT: A bedmaker enjoys a cup of tea at Cambridge University, England, 1939",
