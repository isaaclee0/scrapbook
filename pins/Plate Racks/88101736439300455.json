      "description": "Speedy Clean: In the kitchen, a plate rack above the sink speeds the cleanup process, making it easy to put away clean dishes. Although it's new, the farmhouse-style sink blends perfectly with the home's antique character. A beaded-board backsplash also nods to years gone by. Even the cabinet hardware takes a turn back in time: an antique spoon makes a charming door handle.",
