      "description": "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a lung condition that affects millions of people worldwide. This lung condition occurs when the passages and air sacs of the lungs become thickened and damaged, preventing the lungs from getting enough oxygen. Often, people are not diagnosed with COPD until they are having extreme difficulty breathing, but there are many warning signs before the condition gets to such a severe stage.
