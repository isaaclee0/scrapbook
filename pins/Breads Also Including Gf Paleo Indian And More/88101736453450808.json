      "description": " \n\nAs you can see, during this first fold the dough is very strong even at 90% hydration.\n\nWhen it comes to the strength of the dough, flour, mixing, starter strength, hydration and fermentation are all key contributors.\n\nHere are a couple of tips for folding strong dough:\n\nWhen mixing a wet dough, make sure your hands are wet to prevent the dough from sticking to your hands.\n\nLightly oil and spray your container with water. Note that if the dough is well developed it will stick to itself. Not the container. \n\nIf you're having any issues when it comes to folding your dough, please share them in the comments and I'll provide a few more tips/solutions.\n\n",
