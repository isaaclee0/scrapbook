      "description": "Plantain Tortillas...LOVE how you can bake with plantains without eggs!  I halved the recipe, using just one plantain and did not have to bake as long (probably b/c only one cookie sheet in oven).  Done in 10-12 minutes?  I seasoned with sea salt and italian seasoning and used macadamia oil in them.  Made two large wraps for me, one for lunch today, will see how the other holds up for tomorrow.",
