      "description": "Gotta try this for our Friday family and friends get together!!! Have just done a early try and i'm so excited about this one. Oh my this is going to be such a win this Friday. Leave yourself plenty of time for the prep with 1 hour to rise and 1 hour to rest in the fridge. Your bread will NOT disappoint. I stuck to the recipe and i recommend you do too. I'm looking forward to changing up the pizza ingredients for the mounts of times i'm going to make this amazing bread.",
