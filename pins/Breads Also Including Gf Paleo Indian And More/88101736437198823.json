      "description": "Naan is my best alternative for Chappati during any family occasion. Although it is made up of refined flour but as it is fermented, it is easily digestible. The process of making Naan is similar to making Indian Chappati but the difference is due to fermentation and the kneading. Unlike Chappati dough, Naan dough requires a good effort in kneading or else you will not get the real taste and softness.",
