      "description": "Swiss Chard Grows in Even the Smallest Yards. Swiss Chard is a hardy plant; less finicky in the garden than spinach and milder in flavor than kale. Even apartment dwellers can grow a pot of chard and that pot of chard will provide food for months. You’ll likely need to water the pot daily, depending upon your weather. Even novice gardeners can handle growing Swiss chard. It couldn’t be easier. #gardengrowingtips #containergardens",
