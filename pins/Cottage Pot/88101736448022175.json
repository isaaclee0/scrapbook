      "description": "Do this in the fall. Spring bulbs in Pots : store the potted bulbs in an unheated garage or storage room. You'll need to water every few weeks since the pots won't have access to rainfall. In addition to small pots, pack bulbs \"shoulder-to-shoulder\" in big containers for an abundant display in spring. Toss aside the spacing recommendations so you can get as many bulbs into the container that will fit. I love this!",
