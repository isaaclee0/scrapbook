      "description": "When you go to cut to get the fabric around the arms, I use a Y cut. Don't go wider than the arm itself. If you do, you will most likely see that cut and there is not much you can do about it. Always cut on the short side first, you can always cut more. Also, cut perpendicular to the arm or leg so the fabric will cover everything you want it to cover.",
