      "description": "Quite often when you buy an old dining chair the springs are slack or the webbing has rotted and so the springs fall below the chair bottom. These steps below guide you through the procedure of webbing and attaching new springs before re-stuffing. More pages will be put up as guides to completely re-upholster the chair. These procedures are the same for doing larger chairs and stools.",
