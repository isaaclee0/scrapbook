      "description": "Elbow (olecranon) bursitis is a condition in which a fluid filled sac at the tip of the elbow is inflamed. This can be due to a variety of things, such as trauma, repetitive pressure, or underlying medical conditions. One might notice an obvious area of swelling over the tip of the elbow. In addition, enough swelling can cause the bursa to stretch and be painful. In some uncommon cases, an opening in the skin can allow bacteria to enter the sac. This can lead to a pretty nasty infection.",
