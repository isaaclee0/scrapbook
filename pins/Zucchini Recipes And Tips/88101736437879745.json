      "description": "Minestra di zucca a Veneto-Minestra di zucca Recipe:      This recipe makes 1 large serving!      Only half of a medium size zucchini is needed per serving.  Recipe measurements were descriptive during the age that this recipe was written.  The fortified broth is not strained.  This is the modern translation of the original 1000 year old recipe!      Split 1 medium size zucchini in half lengthwise and save i/2 of the zucchini for another recipe.      Cut the zucchini half lengthwise into quarters.      Cut the seed center core off of the two long quarter slices.      Finely chop the zucchini core.      Cut the seedless zucchini flesh into long thin slices and set them aside.      Heat a sauce pot over medium low heat.      Add 1 pat of unsalted butter.      Add 1 teaspoon of olive oil.      Add the chopped zucchini core.      Saute the squash core, till it caramelizes to a light brown color.      Add 2 minced garlic cloves.      Saute till the garlic becomes aromatic.      Add 1 1/2 cups of light chicken broth.      Add 1 1/2 cups of vegetable broth",
