      "description": "Italian food has always been popular. No meal hits the spot like a long-simmered stew like Osso Bucco with Red Wine, or Chicken with Peppers and Mushrooms, perhaps with a side of Creamy Polenta. The trouble is finding the time for these soulfully flavored dishes. With The Italian Slow Cooker , every cook who can spare 10 minutes of prep time can leave the house for work (or retire for the night) and return to a meal that tastes as though it had been coddled all day by an Italian grandmother.",
