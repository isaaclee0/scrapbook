      "description": "Chicken Enchilada Rice Casserole - Changes: Enchilada Sauce: 12OZ was enough for us. Frozen Corn instead of canned. I would suggest 2 things: 1) make 1.5 cups of each cheese. 2C total was not enough! 2) Bake for 25-30 mins. 20 mins was def not enough. Overall: Quick Recipe! I prepped during my lunch hour & finished once I got home. Simple Ingredients. Basmati rice was delishhhh! Finished product was amazing & we have the perfect ending: LEFTOVERRSSS",
