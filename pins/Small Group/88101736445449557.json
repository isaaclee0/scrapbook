      "description": "Youth Group Fun Night:  Thrift Store Formal. Girls usually went thrifting together beforehand.  Parents brought finger foods and punch.  The balloon arch was made out of PVC pipe, costing about 10 bucks and giving us a great entrance and photo op.  We used mostly line dances like Cupid Shuffle and Cha Cha Slide, and we crowned a Thrift Store King and Queen.  My most favorite youth group fun night ever.",
