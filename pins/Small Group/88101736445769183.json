      "description": "Use these resources to teach about the historical significance of this Jewish holiday and to enjoy Passover activities. Passover is a time to reflect on slavery, redemption, and the strong will of people to persevere: Passover celebrates when God freed the Jews from bondage in Egypt with the leadership of Moses. To commemorate the holiday, we have recipes for cooking kosher treats, printable instructions for making your own Seder plate, and information on the history of the holiday.",
