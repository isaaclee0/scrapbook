      "description": "Susan was just 13 when an evangelist spoke at her school in Uganda and she turned to Christ for salvation. That year, 2009, marked the beginning of the troubles with her father.  At first, her father beat her because of her new faith. Then, in March 2010, he locked her in a room in their mud shanty. #blog",
