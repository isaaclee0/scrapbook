Wenxi Li, a bookstore worker from Beijing, traveled to Shanxi province in 2012 to help local Christians, including Lacheng Ren, stock, set up and open a new bookstore. He brought several hundred Christian books with him from Beijing. But police raided the bookstore and confiscated all the books Wenxi brought.",
