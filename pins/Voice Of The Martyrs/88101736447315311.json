Enduring torture, imprisonment, and separation, Dr. Tson focused on his love for the Lord and the love God gave him for his captors. Scripture states, â€œThere is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear\" (I John 4:18). The message is available for anyone to view for the month of October.",
