      "description": "This week I've been sharing one of the most fun dinner parties I've ever hosted â€” we invited six friends over and threw an Italian polenta party anchored by a four-foot-long board in the middle of the table! Today I want to share the whole party with you and show you how it all came together. From dramatic polenta pouring, to bottles of red wine, to my favorite tip for keeping polenta warm and creamy for hours before dinner, here's a peek inside this cozy supper.",
