      "description": "DIY Cash Envelope System - If you're starting out on the journey of using cash envelopes, you might be using several different business sized envelopes to hold your cash. That's fine until the envelopes get worn out or you tire of hauling around 15 envelopes wherever you go. I created this super easy cash envelope system after seeing my mom's system and LOVE it. So easy to make even a non-crafter can do it! :) @littlegirldesigns.com",
