      "description": "The perfect way to keep my lab, Lilly, entertained for an hour! Unlike a lot of kong stuffing recipes which use treats and fattening foods, the bulk of this kong is dog food taken from her dinner to keep her athletic figure. I use her dog food mixed with some non-fat greek yogurt and unsweetened applesauce and then top it off with pumpkin puree. Pop it in the freezer for several hours and you will have a wonderful food enrichment tool - and an hour of sanity during puppy hood.",
