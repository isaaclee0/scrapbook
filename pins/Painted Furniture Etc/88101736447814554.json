      "description": "Though this thrift store dining table was missing a leaf and had obviously seen some hard use in the past, the classic lines and solid wood construction were just crying out for a little TLC to become a showpiece in someone's home.  Priced at only $15, this table was a steal despite the problems with the fininsh on the tabletop.  Though this makeover does involve some paint, the wood purists among you should also be happy with the final result.",
