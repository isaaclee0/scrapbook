      "description": "Welcome to Furniture Fables! Come with me on this true Sidewalk-Find Trash-To-Treasure story, as I take this out-dated, overly accessorized, and burnt (ouch!) '70's Thomasville Bar to a stunning, one-of-a-kind, PINK Furniture Flip. We'll explore that Power Of Pink with a Fusion Mineral Paint color that was so sexy, I was sad when it sold in half a day! (And so was my husband!!) Skills include: cleaning, prep sanding, filling, priming, painting, wallpapering, top-coating, and waxing.",
