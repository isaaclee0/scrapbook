      "description": "GREY& GOLD WALL SHELVES Â£250 Just stunning. The combination of dark grey and Regency Gold just makes this piece extra special. These shelves have been the top part of a dresser and have little hooks for cups and the top shelf holds plates. Wall fixings are positioned at the back. Given to us by a neighbour who was on their way to the tip with it when we rescued it. We added little wood carved ormalu to the top and highlighted it.",
