      "description": "This kid’s room from Ashley, of Simply Designing, is full of fun details, like this DIY loft bed and shiplap accent wall. Ashley used shiplap siding to build a climbing wall in her son’s bedroom. Then, she created a lofted bed to finish off the fun and playful space. Finally, Ashley painted her accent wall a dark shade of Iron Mountain to keep the room feeling simple.",
