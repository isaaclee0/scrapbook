      "description": "Even a utilitarian area like a laundry or craft room can wear the same style as the rest of the house. Paying extra attention to the design of a hard-working room will make it fun, as well as functional. Don't hesitate to transfer detergent into shapely glass canisters, hang vintage metal shelves to hold essentials, or press a large woven basket into service as a hamper. These items have to work hard anyway -- they might as well be beautiful!",
