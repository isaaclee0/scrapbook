      "description": "A lot of ‘selfless’ behavior is actually very selfish. If you’re doing something with expectation, you’re not authentically giving. It’s conditional giving. There’s a big difference. An expectation means we have a desired result. We think we’re upset with someone else, but what we are really upset with what the expectation we created. We believed our behavior would change someone else’s. This is the ego in action.",
