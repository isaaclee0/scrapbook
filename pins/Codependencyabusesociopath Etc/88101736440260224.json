      "description": "Emotional Abuse can be often worse than physical abuse, because it stays with the person & holds their mind a prisoner. They accept the physical abuse because their mind is conditioned that they deserve it or what the person says must be true. I sadly know this & it can take years to retrain & believe in truth, not fiction & escape all forms of Abuse.",
