      "description": "Canning butter (says it will keep for 3 years).  Comment says: My cousin makes this... but shakes the butter a few times as it cools. When it is finished, it is nicely blended, the consistency of soft margarine or butter from a tub, no mixing needed, great for spreading on toast just as it is. She now cans all her butter and rotates it into her years supply.",
