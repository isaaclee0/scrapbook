      "description": "Got lemons? Don’t waste the peels! Instead, turn them into a delicious, zesty, sweet dried lemon powder. Lemon powder is easy to make, and can be used in more ways than you’d imagine! Season your salad dressing, dips, vegetables, meat, fish, tea, baked goods, yogurt, and more. Use dehydrated lemon peel powder as a replacement for fresh lemon zest in any recipe – 1 tsp of lemon powder for every tablespoon of called-for zest.",
