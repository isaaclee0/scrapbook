      "description": "This is a beautiful photo by \"Diamoneyes\". My uncle got to hold a hummingbird like this. He worked on an oil rig off the coast of Brazil. They were in the path of the hummingbird migration so the hummingbirds would land on the rig every year and rest before the final push to shore. They often got to hold the birds and would even load up boats to take some of the birds to shore who were just too tired to go with rest of them. ~WR",
