      "description": "Nutria Stew    I would say…no way, but this habit of eating this “rat” like creature comes from the far away China and during the 17th century spread all over the world.    Nutria is a rodent which likes the water a lot, a mixture between the water rat and the beaver, and it is a herbivore animal with a very beautiful fir. In the beginning they were raised for their fir but soon during the great famine and the war became a valuable source of meat.",
