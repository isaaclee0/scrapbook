      "description": "Have you ever seen a painting of an elephant? Probably. What about a picture of an elephant painting a painting of an elephant? Meet Suda who lives in Maetaeng Elephant Park in Chiang Mai, Thailand. In the early years, Suda along with other elephants would paint abstract brush strokes on paper, and slowly over time, they learned to produce two and three dimensional art. Elephants have a keen memory and show that here by being able to repeat the same paintings and techniques.",
