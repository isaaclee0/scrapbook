      "description": "\"Schoep, a 19-year-old arthritic dog is being cradled in his owners arms in Lake Superior. Schoep falls asleep every night when he is carried into the lake. The buoyancy of the water soothes his arthritic bones. Lake Superior is very warm right now, so the temp of the water is perfect. John rescued Schoep as an 8 month old puppy, and he's been by his side through many adventures.\" Click through to listen to the story with a Kleenex. LOVE IS LOVE.",
