      "description": "Barcelona-based artist Gabi Guiard doesnâ€™t humanize her chimp subjects, but she certainly sheds light on their individual personalities. She spent time at a sanctuary in Kenya photographing the mammals. Sweetwaters Chimpanzee Sanctuary at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy provides lifelong refuge to orphaned and abused chimps, and their total residency currently numbers 41. The sanctuary offers safety while workers nurse the rescued chimps back to health.",
