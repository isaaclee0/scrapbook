      "description": "Lucy: American Staffordshire Terrier, NY. Available at Pet Finder & lucky to be alive. Used as a breeding machine in Colombia & beaten so badly that her broken nose & jaw are permanently offset, Lucy was saved, is healed and as dogs miraculously do, she's forgiven the past & is ready to love humans unconditionally again. We can learn a lot  from Lucy on forgiveness.",
