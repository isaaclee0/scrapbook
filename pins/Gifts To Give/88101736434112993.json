      "description": "Casey Cline. Rochester, NY. This library is special because it took a community of people to create. The library is made out of all repurposed materials. My neighbor pitched in some materials. My father helped me set it up. The local college I work for donated the perennials for the garden. My neighborhood is loving it and enjoying it already! Total cost for the project $14. Overall benefits for my community- priceless!",
