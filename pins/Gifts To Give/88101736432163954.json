      "description": "All you need is an empty Kleenex box. Dollar bills. Tape the dollar bills together end to end with Scotch tape.  Obviously the more dollar bills the greater the “WOW.” Stuff them in the Kleenex box with just one dollar sticking out of the box. It’s fun to watch someone’s eyes grow wider as they pull out the dollars that go on and on.   Make a tag that says: Don’t blow it all in one place. Happy Birthday.",
