Now as He walked by the sea of Galilee He saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea... 17 And He said to them, “Come you after Me and I shall make you Fishers of Men.” It is a reminder to reach out to our brothers and sisters and keep them connected... to be better human beings and do more for humanity.
