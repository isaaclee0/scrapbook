      "description": "Just picked up a vintage chippy cast iron umbrella stand today at my favorite junk shop...If I would have seen this umbrella upcycle idea, I would have totally bought the not so attractive umbrella she had also and gave it a face lift like this one...Love the idea of repurposing vintage fabric to pretty it up! Will be buying it if it's still there next time and am totally doing this!",
