      "description": "They are very easy to make. Just use Arnotts Chocolate Royal biscuits and drizzle some melted white chocolate on top. I cut my spearmint leaf in half as they are quite thick, then wait til the chocolate has started to set a little and place it on. The original recipe calls for a jaffa as the cherry, but I really don't like jaffa, and so I use a little red M&M. I think they work a little better anyway",
