      "description": "My mom is 91 years old now, but through the years, when I was a kid, the best thing about Thanksgiving was the stuffing. Hers was the best I ever ate. Loaded with flavor and completely delicious. When I got married and started my own family, I made sure I had this recipe in my recipe box. I've used it all my life.",
