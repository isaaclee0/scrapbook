      "description": "In Britain, the main Christmas meal is traditionally eaten in the early afternoon and often includes: roast turkey or goose, brussels sprouts, roast potatoes, roast parsnips, roast chestnuts, bread sauce, cranberry sauce, rich nutty stuffing, tiny sausages wrapped in bacon (pigs in a blanket), and lashings of hot gravy. For pudding (dessert) rich, fruity Christmas Pudding doused in flaming brandy. A Christmas cracker is placed next to each plate-ready to be pulled to see what suprise falls out.",
