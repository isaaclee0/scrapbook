      "description": "I made this Gingerbread Nativity based on ideas from a couple of similar ones that other people made (pinned them in this collection).  The aluminum tea light holders are baked into the gingerbread base (there is another one in the stable behind the manger) The roof of the stable has an opening cut in it so that the heat can escape and the sky, star & angles are given a soft glow of light.  All of the pieces were cut out of gingerbread by hand tracing cardboard figures which I made.",
