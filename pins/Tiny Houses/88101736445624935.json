      "description": "Campaign Furniture, English, 1810. The Tent Chair has a 3 section pine frame seat which folds out to extend its length for use as a bed. For travel, the 2 bolts that join the back board to the sides are removed and they fold on their hinges to lay on top of the seat. The sides will also lift off at their hinges. The back has 2 mahogany bars that twist vertically to add support to the back board. (photo 1)",
