      "description": "Tiny house with built in stairs/storage underneath. I like this because it's a loft bedroom, but with more separation and proper stairs. AND the only space that is \"wasted\" is the frost 3 or maybe 4 steps. The remaining under stairs space makes really great storage, and with the bathroom on the other side some of that area could open into the bath and some into the kitchen.",
