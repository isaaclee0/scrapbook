      "description": "Dr. Newton’s studies suggest the muscles of people with ME/CFS are not efficiently removing the acids that build up during exercise. It’s possible this acid buildup is contributing to the hyperventilation, and, of course, the exercise problems in ME/CFS (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome). Earlier she mentioned she was determining if drugs could reverse that acid buildup.",
