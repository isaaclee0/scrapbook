      "description": "\"It is the most effective treatment for severe ME/CFS that I have found inÂ my 21 years\" - Dr. David Bell.   Recently was admitted to hospital for a viral infection in my gut and was given saline drip for 4 days. I can say that by the 2nd day,  even though i was in pain, my energy level was sky high. The moment i was discharged from the hospital, my body weakened tremendously. And then i googled and found this.   So saline drip to help lighten the exhaustion from fibromyalgia/cfs? I think yes.",
