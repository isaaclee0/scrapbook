      "description": "Post from a neurologist about ways that gluten sensitive people can cross react with coffee.    He points out that gastrointestinal upset is the least common presentation of gluten sensitivity. More common are migraines, vertigo, seizures, epilepsy, neuropathy, ataxia, and ADD/ADHD. Some other ones which he doesn't point out are joint pain, vitamin and mineral deficiencies in blood work, and bone density loss. Fatigue and poor immune system response are in there as well.",
