When we live with illness we can easily feel guilty about all that we cannot do, perhaps how our family misses out on things because of our disease. To compensate, it is easy to give in to everything they want that we are \"somewhat\" capable of. We are all guilty of being too nice when we should have set healthy boundaries instead. And just because we can do something, doesn't mean we should.",
