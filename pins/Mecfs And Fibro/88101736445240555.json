      "description": "\"We have discovered and reported for the first time abnormalities of a certain receptor in immune cells of the body and hence it's likely to be in every cell in the body.      \"What this is, is a defect in the receptor, which is a change in the gene transcription of these receptors, meaning they no longer function the way they should. What the receptors should do is to be able to transfer calcium from outside the cell to the inside.\"",
