It seems we are at odds with our environment. Having this issue leads to so many health issues. Look at the graphic, do you see a lot of health issues you deal with? If so, please take some time and try to make your home environment more chemical free. When living with Fibromyalgia we are already over-sensitive to so many things and each of these things do cause us fibro flares. One less flare is a GOOD THING.  <3 Cindy ~FCFA | Facebook",
