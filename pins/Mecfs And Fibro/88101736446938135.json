      "description": "Being chronically ill is devastating, isolating, and complicated to say the least. It forces us to know the limits of our bodies and also how very fragile they can be. It makes us long for support, comfort and understanding friendships. Our illnesses are a part of our journey and considering these things before we answer, \"How are you?\" can benefit both ourselves and the person asking!  #chronicillness #invisibleillness #spoonie #explainchronicillness  via @kimbajoy89",
