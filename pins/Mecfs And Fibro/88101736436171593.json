      "description": "Dr. DeMeirleir believes the sleep problems in ME/CFS start with the  over-production of a cytokine, IL-6 , known to be triggered by infections, which causes increased sleepiness.  In a kind of a cascade effect, another  cytokine called IL-10 apparently tries to tamp down the inflammation  caused by IL-6 â€¦.and causes more sleep problems.",
