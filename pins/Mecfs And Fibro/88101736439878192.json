      "description": "Funny but for those who have a chronic disease like fibromyalgia & also experience memory loss, this is also a bit sad. Just to remember simple things would be great. I miss who I was & others do too. Some think if you were more active, got off of some medicine, or exercised you'd just improve or be normal like them. My bad health is really all my fault they must think. I guess if one can't see an illness, it must mean it's not there! Understanding/mercy is what we need.",
