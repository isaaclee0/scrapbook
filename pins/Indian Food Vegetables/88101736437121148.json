Sold on every street corn in Mumbai, and now widespread in other Indian cities and towns too, Bhel Puri is a wonderful preparation of puffed rice tossed together with a lot of tangy chutneys, aromatic seasonings, crunchy veggies and flavourful garnishes. Now, you can recreate the magic in your own kitchen with this simple recipe.",
