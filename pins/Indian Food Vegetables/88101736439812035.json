      "description": "Basic malvani gravy, apart from coconut, malvani food features a lot of onion-based curries and malvani paste/masala, which is a special blend of spices that lends the cuisine its distinctive taste. Malvani gravy is reddish brown in colour and very spicy because of the usage of more red chillies. Apart from authentic konkani recipes like cashew curry, use this basic gravy in rice preparations like masala bhaat, lentil preparations etc.",
