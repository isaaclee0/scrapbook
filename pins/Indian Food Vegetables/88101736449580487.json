Use as an accompaniment to curries, rice, lamb, cheese with crusty breads, etc. Mix some into fat-free sour cream or fat-free yoghurt for a quick, healthy dip, or mix some into low-fat cream cheese for a delicious spread on celery sticks or crackers of your choice. Sugar-free and salt-free  #canning.",
