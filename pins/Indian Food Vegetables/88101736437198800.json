      "description": "I found this recipe in a book that mentioned it was helpful in weight loss after pregnancy. Even otherwise in our culture garlic is consumed in the post partum period because it alleviates gastro- intestinal issues and thereby soothes the tummy of the  mother as well as baby. This is one recipe that has stayed with me after pregnancy till date.",
