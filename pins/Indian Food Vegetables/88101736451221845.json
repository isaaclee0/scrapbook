      "description": "This Sri Lankan Coconut Dhal is one of those super easy dishes that really doesn't require you to spend a lot of time in the kitchen - hello, perfect midweek dinner! Lightly spiced with turmeric, cumin seeds and mustard seeds it's cooled down and made extra creamy by a generous helping of coconut milk. I serve it up on a bed of rice, but it's just as good on it's own, or with some roti.",
