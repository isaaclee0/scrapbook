      "description": "Pandoli is a Gujarati snack cooked in a unique style using a double boiler. Chola dal reinforces this recipe with nutrients like proteins, calcium, iron, and folic acid. However, it is very important to soak the dal for a few hours to increase its digestibility. You can also make pandolis in moulds. I have added spinach to make the pandolis interesting and colourful; actually, you can add any leafy vegetable of your choice.",
