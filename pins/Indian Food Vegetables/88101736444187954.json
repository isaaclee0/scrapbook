      "description": "I’d say, “steam them, season them, and gobble them up!” you should ideally follow this process in quick succession and serve the palak methi na muthia soon after steaming—as freshness ensures the greatest satisfaction as far as this dish goes. It does take a while to painstakingly clean and chop the spinach and fenugreek leaves for making the dumplings, but it is definitely worth the while.",
