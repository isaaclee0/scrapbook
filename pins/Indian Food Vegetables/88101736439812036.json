      "description": "Dum Aloo gets its characteristic flavour and texture from the intensely-flavoured gravy that the potatoes are cooked in.    The gravy gets its deep flavour and luscious texture from a paste of onions and spices, cooked along with tomato pulp and fresh cream.    You can make a batch of Basic Dum Aloo Gravy using this recipe, and use it immediately, or deep-freeze it to whip up your favourite dishes in minutes when you wish to.",
