      "description": "Fresh mushroom curry is a very indian way of cooking mushrooms. Fresh coriander and boiled onion paste make this gravy very flavoursome, totally overriding the blandness of mushrooms. Remember to soak the mushrooms in hot water for two minutesâ€”this not only softens them, but also helps clean them thoroughly.",
