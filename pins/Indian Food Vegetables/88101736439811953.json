      "description": "The masala used here is an aromatic mixture of spices, coconut and cashews. It sounds rich, and is indeed befitting a royal meal! make sure the masala is blended well and cooked just as mentioned here, to be assured of a good result. And it is not just the masala that is worth a mention. Adding chopped cabbage makes this more nutritious and adds a new, slightly contrasting touch to the recipe. Replete with the tang of lemons, this comforting dal goes well with both roti and rice.",
