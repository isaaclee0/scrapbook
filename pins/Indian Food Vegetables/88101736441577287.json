      "description": "Crispy outside and soft inside, these scrumptious Poha Bhajias are perfect for a rainy day. Curd imparts a nice tangy flavour to the beaten rice, while an assortment of nutritious veggies add to the taste and volume of these bhajias. The curd also plays an important role in increasingly the crispiness of these besan-bound bhajias, while the tempering imparts a traditional yet tempting aroma to this delicious snack.",
