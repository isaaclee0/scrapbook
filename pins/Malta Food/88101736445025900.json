      "description": "Maltese Timpana _ This dish is Maltaâ€™s answer to pasta pie. It is most likely Sicilian in origin, given the proximity of the 2 Mediterranean islands, however countless regional versions exist in Italy, where it is known as timballo. The basis for this home-style pie is macaroni, penne or other tubular-shaped pasta tossed in a stew made from several different meats, including beef & offal, then encased in puff pastry for an extra-hearty bake.",
