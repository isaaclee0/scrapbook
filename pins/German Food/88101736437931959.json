      "description": "Slow Cooker Sauerbraten Recipe~ Normally it takes 5 days to marinate the roast (you have to turn it every day) and that takes some planning. But this iis one of my favorite German recipes (I'm mostly of German descent). I grew up eating German food and learned from my Gramma how to make all the old country dishes. My husband hates German food *thunks head on table* D'oh!!!!!",
