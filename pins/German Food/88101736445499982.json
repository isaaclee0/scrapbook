      "description": "You don't need to travel to Munich to eat this traditional German dish called J채gersp채tzle! This Bavarian classic is often served at the Oktoberfest and makes for a seriously exciting family dinner. They are small dumplings made from flour, eggs and milk. The sauce is a delicious rich Mushroom gravy, perfect for fall! My recipe was handed down to me by my Bavarian grandmother, so it's 100% authentic and tastes simply amazing.",
