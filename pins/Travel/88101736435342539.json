      "description": "This type of barn is so rare in the United States that The National Trust for Historic Preservation is protecting most of them. It is located in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains and the orchard country of Biglerville, Pennsylvania, an area which is famous for apples and other tree fruits. The round barn, also called a “barrel barn,” was built in 1914 by the Noah Sheely family.",
