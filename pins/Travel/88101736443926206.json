      "description": "Fly Ranch Gyser in Nevada, a little known phenomenon in Washoe County, it was accidentally created in 1916 during well drilling.The geothermically heated pack of water found a weak spot in the wall in the 1960s and began escaping, creating a geyser.      Over the years, dissolved minerals created the mound that water now spews up to five metres from.  The geyser contains several terraces discharging water into 30 to 40 pools over an area of 30 hectares             (74 acres).",
