      "description": "when we stop at a hotel, I just tell my husband which tote to bring in.  When we stay for a few nights at a time, we still only need one tote.  It’s amazing how many clothes can fit (especially when packing summer clothes)!  I put the clean clothes in a dresser (if there is one) and we fill the tote with the dirty clothes as we wear them.  It’s great when we arrive home to take the tote to the laundry room.  No sorting through bags/suitcases for dirty and clean clothes all mixed together!",
