      "description": "Orkney Grimbister Farm Cheese - A delicious crumbly cow's milk cheese produced on a small family farm near Kirkwall. In the past there were many Scottish farms producing such cheeses - of the fresh and zesty variety, however few of these now exist but Hilda Seator and family are maintaining the tradition much to the delight of I.J.Mellis Cheesemongers. This is a great light and citrusy cheese ideal with an oatcake or on fresh crusty French bread.: I J. Mellis",
