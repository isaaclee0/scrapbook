      "description": "Is Jamaica dangerous ?? YES ! When you grow up in JA, have little to call you're own, and struggle to make ends meet..and you grow up in the ghetto. Its a dog eat dog world where life is cheap and you can be shot or stabbed just for being in the wrong neighborhood. A place where on average, 100 murders are committed per month..one of the highest in the world ! Cops are often killed JUST so their gun can be stolen. And gangs have politicians in their back pocket...its corrupt !",
