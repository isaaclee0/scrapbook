      "description": "This sloe gin recipe takes just ten minutes to prepare and anything up to three months to infuse. Sloes, the hard, blue-black fruit of the blackthorn, appear from the end of September/early October depending on the weather and where you live in the UK. If you can't wait until the first frost to pick them, store overnight in the freezer before starting the recipe.",
