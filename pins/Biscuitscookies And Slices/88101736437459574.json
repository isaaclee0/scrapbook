If there was one recipe that I came close to never sharing with anyone, this would be it... but then I thought, what better way for my grandmother's memory to live on than with her famous cookie recipe? I can't remember a single Christmas without her making all of her loved ones these delicious cookies, and I've never tasted another like them. They're so easy too, it's sometimes hard to grasp that something this simple can taste so darn good!",
