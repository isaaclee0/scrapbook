      "description": "I've loved peppermint slice ever since I was a child. It reminds me of birthday parties, school fetes and afternoon tea at home after school. These days there's nothing better than a piece of peppermint slice and a cup of tea on a rainy afternoon. This is my go to recipe whenever I'm feeling nostalgic. This recipe freezes well so I always make 2.",
