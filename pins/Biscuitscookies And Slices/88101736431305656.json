Ingredients-  1.5 cups of oats  2-3 super rippened bananas  1 cup of unsweetened applesauce  handful of craisins to taste  cinnamon    Pretty much just throw everything together, mix it up pretty well, throw it on a baking sheet at 350 for about 35 minutes and then go to town! It's great and super healthy for you!",
