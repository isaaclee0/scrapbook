Tickled up with a tad of ground ginger they are a very quick and easy cookie to make. They're an easy bake for children and perfect with a cuppa. Just six ingredients is all it takes for these cookies to bake into a lovely golden, thin and snappy crunch. #honeysnap #gingersnap #cookies #easycookies #recipewinners.com",
