      "description": "Magluba â€“ Up Side Down (Chicken & Rice)  This is a traditional Palestinian dish that I read about and had to try. It works great for Friday night and even for leftovers. It does take a bit of work, but is easier than it sounds. I made it with chicken, but it can be made with meat or lamb and would be amazing.",
