      "description": "This gently spiced beef pie, adapted from the “Zahav: A World of Israeli Cooking” by the chef Michael Solomonov, is scented with cinnamon, dill and parsley. The recipe calls for purchased puff pastry, which makes it extremely simple to make yet wonderfully rich to eat. Leftovers will last for a few days in the refrigerator. Reheat at 350 degrees before serving. (Photo: Andrew Scrivani for The New York Times)",
