      "description": "The terrace of this north-facing garden which I designed in Warwickshire incorporates this urn and plinth which was original to the house and part of the history of the place. It is now the centrepiece of the formal garden which I surrounded with 'instant' box edging. The underplanting is of Anemone x hybrida 'Honorine Jobert'.
