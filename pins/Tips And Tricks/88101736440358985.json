      "description": "Quilting Tip of the Day: Dawn dishwashing soap is great to wash your finished quilts. It's similar to Synthrapol, a detergent dyers use to keep fugitive dyes from redepositing on fabric. I use just a tablespoon or two per quilt so it doesn't foam up the machine. I also wash new fabric with it for the same reason. (Wash new fabric in HOT water.) Cheap and available everywhere.",
