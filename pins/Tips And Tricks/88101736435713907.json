      "description": "THIS REALLY WORKS AND LAUNDRY IS SUPER SOFT!!!   Soak a hand towel in fabric softener. Squeeze out any remaining drops from the towel.    Hang it over a chair (or outside on a clothes line) to dry. My house smelled super clean for the three days while this towel was drying completely. Yes, it took three days!    You must make sure it dries completely!    After the towel dries you just throw it in your dryer along with clothes and use it as a dryer sheet for 40-50 loads before soaking again.",
