      "description": "Cast Iron Dutch Oven Chili...OH MY GOSH!! This is SO SO SO good! Jared got seconds, and didn't even put shredded cheese OR sour cream in it (he said it would ruin the flavor, that's a huge compliment) I didn't use the bay leaves because I didn't have any, only 1 can of diced tomatoes, then added a fresh diced tomato and a little extra chili sauce. I browned the meat in a skillet first to speed things up, and let it simmer for about 2 hours!",
