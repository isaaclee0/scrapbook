      "description": "Pot roasts exist in many cuisines, of course, and the Italians have stracotto, which means \"overcooked.\" Like many other roasts, this one cooks low and slow after itâ€™s seared. But here, red wine adds depth to the tomatoes, and a smattering of fresh basil contributes to its complexity. Make this for your next Sunday supper, or on a cold winter evening.
