      "description": "I worked in a fine dining steakhouse for six years, so I'm very picky when it comes to my burgers. If they're not tender, juicy and flavorful, they're just not worth it. Problem is, it's difficult to replicate steakhouse burgers at home because most steakhouses use closely-guarded recipes and custom ground beef mixes, both of which are hard to find",
