      "description": "Jesus taught His disciples to set an example of good works so people would give glory to the Father in heaven. Everyone has influence. Our influence is shown by our works, not just our words. Evil conduct leads people to dishonor God, but good works lead people to glorify God. Is your light shining for God's glory?",
