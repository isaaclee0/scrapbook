      "description": "\"I wanted to share this image with you. In my hand are life sized replicas of a non-menstruating uterus and a menstruating uterus.     Can you get over the difference in size???!!!    This is why we feel so heavy at the beginning of our bleed. Why it can feel like our uterus is about to drop out and hit the pavement (or is that just me?). And why we need to take things slooooooow.    Many grateful thanks to Jacintha of the Jocelyn Centre in Sydney for this fabulous visual aid\"",
