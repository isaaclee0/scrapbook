      "description": "Dr. Simoncini, an oncologist in Rome, Italy has pioneered sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) therapy as a means to treat cancer. The fundamental theory behind this treatment lies in the fact that despite a number of variable factors, the formation and spreading of tumors is simply the result of the presence of a simple fungal infection.   Sodium bicarbonate, unlike other anti-fungal remedies is extremely diffusible and retains its ability to penetrate the tumor. It quickly renders tumors defenseless.",
