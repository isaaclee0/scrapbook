      "description": "\\The Australian Chief Medical Officer and all state and territory chief health officers agreed to a target for 95 per cent of children to be fully immunised.  Figures released today show for one- and two-year-olds, none of the 31 primary health network areas across the country met the target, while only two areas did for five-year-olds.  The National Health Performance Authority report shows more than 84,000 children aged one, two and five were not fully immunised last financial year.",
