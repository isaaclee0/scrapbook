      "description": "It's human to confuse our thoughts with facts. Almost everyone does this at one point or another. But the depressed person does it more often and make bigger mistakes. Once you stop this confusion, you're on your way out of depression. If you're depressed, it's particularly important to separate thoughts from facts, since you will have more distorted thoughts. And when you believe and act on distorted thoughts, you become more depressed.~ Dr. Neal Houston, Sociologist",
