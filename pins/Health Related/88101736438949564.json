      "description": "DIY Air Purifier for about $30 Bucks!  I was skeptical, but after watching the video from University of Michigan Health Systemâ€™s Sinus Center, I was convinced!  I went out and bought 2 filters.  They were not the Merv 13 but they were close 80 ~ 85% with Microban.  I have had them running for about an hour and my sinuses feel soo much better!",
