      "description": "GMO French Study Results on Smart Health talk. Last Sept 2012 one of the most significant studies ever done on GMOs was release in France. Monsanto only allows their own scientists to study their GMOs so no one can find out just how bad they are. Group of scientists went underground for two years and set up well designed study on Round Up Ready pesticide/GMO corn. Monsanto studies in past only lasted three months with small sample sizes. First time anyone demonstrated long term exposure.",
