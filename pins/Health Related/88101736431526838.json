      "description": "Amazing: Grind a handful of rice until u get a fine but coarse flour. Add a few spoons of raw honey to the mixture along with enough apple cider vinegar to obtain a thick paste. If the cracks are very deep, add a spoon of olive oil. Soak feet for 20 minutes & gently massage with this paste.-pinning for when i'm old... you don't have  to be old for feet like this, you just have to hate wearing shoes. Feels like I just got a pedicure!! Works for smooth hands too! :)",
