      "description": "just revealed today on Dr. Oz    California Poppy liquid dropper - take 3/4 tsp 1 time a day before bed.    This is a remedy replacement for pain.  Those who rely on Advil, Vicodin, Percocet  or other strong pain killers for constant pain that can become addicting - try the California Poppy liquid drops instead.    This is NOT addicting but works just as strong as such pain pills. Also note that it will assist in sleeping so take before bed.",
