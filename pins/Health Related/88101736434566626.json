      "description": "I did this for D'Artagnan. WOW! what a difference it made. The bumpy, twisted design and buckwheat hull mattress topper are just what he needed to address his sensory needs. I didn't purchase it from this company, instead I paid a seamstress to make the entire thing. She also made an aromatherapy pad that attaches to the end where the pillow goes. We change between using eucalyptus or vanilla as the filler which seems to calm him. When it comes to sleep, have to think out of the box.",
