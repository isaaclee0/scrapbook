      "description": "Previous studies suggest a role of cannabis in slowing the progression of Alzheimer’s and now scientists can explain why. Researchers have shown for the first time how cannabinoids – the active chemicals in marijuana – are able to reduce the build-up of a key indicator of Alzheimer’s disease - beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaque. the new findings reveal how cannabinoids reverse the build-up of plaque in Alzheimer’s by expelling it from the brain.",
