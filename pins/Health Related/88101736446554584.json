      "description": "This 13 year-old scoliosis patient from Connecticut was told that she needs spinal fusion surgery. Instead, her parents brought her to Boston to be fit with the Cheneau-Gensingen brace this past July. Later in the summer, she came back to Scoliosis 3DC to do a Schroth Best Practice® exercise program. Her out-of-brace x-ray from December 11th reveals a 15° thoracic curve reduction and 11° lumbar curve reduction. Keep up the great work! #Scoliosis #Schroth Method #CheneauGensingenBrace #Results",
