Those of us with autonomic dysfunction have problems with the things that we don't control consciously- i.e. heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, circulation, digestion, nerve activity, body temperature, eyes (which causes light sensitivity, blurred vision and vision disturbances) - a lot of things we don't normally think about.
