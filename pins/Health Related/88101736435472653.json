      "description": "Misophonia: a decreased sound tolerance for certain sounds. It is believed to result from abnormally strong connections between the autonomic and limbic systems in the brain, rather than over-activity of the auditory system. People who have misophonia are most commonly annoyed, or even enraged, by such ordinary sounds as other people eating, breathing, etc. Though a few sufferers are bothered by sounds they make themselves, most are not. The reactions are completely involuntary.Source: wikipedia",
