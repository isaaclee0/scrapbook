      "description": "Build into interior wall only. Walls are usually 2x4 construction. Use stud finder. Open 30\"x80 3/4\"of wall for a bi-fold door. By adjustable metal shelf brackets. Shelving is usually 1\"x3 1/2\" (measure), cut to needed lengths. Bi-fold door will hang off the 2'x3\" trim because you only have enough room for shelves and cans in the wall. We have left electrical plugs inside the wall. Painted everything to match the wall color. My husband made me 2 of them. Life saver! Great storage! Have fun!",
