      "description": "You can remedy a squeaky door hinge with a shot of dry lubricant. But protect the surrounding woodwork from overspray by slitting a piece of thin cardboard and slipping it around the hinge barrel first. Wipe away any excess lube to prevent drips, then open and close the door a few times to work it into the hinge pin before it dries.",
