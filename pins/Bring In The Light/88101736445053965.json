      "description": "I've picked the style of window we're having for above our kitchen sink and it will look a lot like this (same colour handles and bar) but with 3 glazed panes not 2. Collecting @howdensjoinery samples of the new kitchen on Saturday so will be able to see everything together in the room they'll sit in. Hope it all looks OK! Gotta try nail a colour scheme for the walls and woodwork when I have all the samples together #housetohome #houses_ofthe_world #windowview #windowlovers #homerenovation #home",
