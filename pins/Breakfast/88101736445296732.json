      "description": "This gravy is practically a must in most southern kitchens. It is called by many names, sausage gravy, sawmill gravy, white gravy. It is similar to the one served at the Cracker Barrel restaurant and made in so many southern kitchens.   At first, I thought, this is too simple a recipe to post.  Everyone knows how to make gravy, right",
