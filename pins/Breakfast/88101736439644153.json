      "description": "I love granola. I've been known to eat it for dinner. I used to make the stuff by the gallon. But that love affair ended a while back because, after reading the book Nourishing Traditions I knew I didn't want to eat grains that weren't properly prepared. And the oats in granola were definitely not soaked or fermented. Which is why granola can be so hard to digest.",
