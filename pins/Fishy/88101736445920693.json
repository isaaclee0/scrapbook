      "description": "This fish recipe can be made outdoors on the barbecue, or you can pan-fry the fish indoors (or grill it on a stove-top grill. You'll love the tenderness of the fish combined with this fantastic, tastebud-awakening sauce, which can be made anywhere from mild to extra spicy to suit your taste. And nearly any whole \"white-fleshed\" fish can be used for this recipe, such as rainbow trout, snapper, sea bream, talapia, gray mullet, or other fish of your choice. ENJOY!",
