      "description": "These prawns are absolutely fantastic.  Every time I make them I marvel at the density and depth of the flavors.  I typically leave the Cayenne pepper out of about half of them if I'm cooking for the whole family.  I often serve these in combination with a Moroccan chicken, fish, or lamb dish, but they work fine on their own too.",
