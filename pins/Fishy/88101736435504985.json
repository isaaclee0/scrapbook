      "description": "'Fish pie' is a traditional dish made with a white fish in a white sauce made using the milk the fish was poached in. Prawns and hard boiled eggs are  common additional ingredients. Oven-baked in a deep dish topped with mashed potatoes (sometimes with cheese or vegetables such as onions and leeks) and baked. Sometimes referred to as \"fisherman's pie\" because the topping is similar to that of shepherd's pie, in that it uses mashed potatoes.",
