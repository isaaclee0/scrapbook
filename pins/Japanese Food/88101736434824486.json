      "description": "Japanese Rolled Omelet (Tamagoyaki) recipe - This is a slightly sweet but delicate omelet that is often packed into Japanese bento boxes and also served at sushi bars as tamago nigiri. I love its aesthetic: yellow and all rolled up in a small package that is easily picked up with a pair of chopsticks. Plus, the taste is utterly delicious and unlike any omelets I have ever tasted! #japanese #eatinglight #30minutemeals",
