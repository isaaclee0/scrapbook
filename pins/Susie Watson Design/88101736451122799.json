      "description": "This french inspired armoire has multiple uses. It has shelving below to hide accessories, it can store glass, pottery, books and so many other items that you want it to. It also has a shelf that slides out to be a desk so you can pull up a chair and use this as a work space too. If you need it just purely for storage then close the doors on this stunning french armoire. Suitable for kitchens, living rooms, bedrooms, hallways even bathrooms to store laundry in .. if your bathroom is a palace :)",
