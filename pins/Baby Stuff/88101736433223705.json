      "description": "A mother going into premature labor had to lie about the age of her unborn 19 week baby saying she was 23 weeks because it is standard protocol not to attempt to resuscitate a baby born less than 22 weeks. Her premature baby thrived after birth. Life is precious and begins at conception. There is no denying this.",
