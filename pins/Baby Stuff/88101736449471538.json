      "description": "...I‚Äôve nursed for a total of three and a half years now üí™üèªand one thing I‚Äôve found is that a good nursing bra is a total game changer, especially for those frequent night feedings. Even better when you can find one that is created with style and functionality in mind, like this 24/7 Classic Nursing Bra by @thirdlove, which I have on in the shade Taupe. Their sizes range from A-I cups and 32-48 band widths, but make sure to take their size quiz to help you order the right size.",
