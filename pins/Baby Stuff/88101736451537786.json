      "description": "Incredible images and movies of every stage of a baby's development. By 9 weeks thumb sucking begins and the baby may swallow amniotic fluid. The baby can also grasp an object, move the head forward and back, open and close the jaw, move the tongue, sigh, and stretch. The nerve receptors in the face, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet can sense and respond to light touch. Following a light touch on the sole of the foot, the baby will bend the hip and knee and may curl the toes.",
