      "description": "Be weary of how you talk to your older child. Saying things like \"I can't right now, I'm feeding the baby\" or \"Please be quiet, the baby is sleeping\" may lead them to resent your newborn. Rephrase them saying something like \"Go grab a book and I will read to you while we feed the baby\" involving your older child in the process will save some grief.",
