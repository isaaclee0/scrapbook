      "description": "Most cords are cut when they look like the one on the left. This is premature clamping, practiced for years without evidence to its benefits or downsides.    Nowadays, even OBs are calling for a change in practice, to wait to clamp the cord until it is white and limp like the one on the right. This ensures the baby gets all of his blood.
