      "description": "A Cup of Tea  When the world is all at odds And the mind is all at sea Then cease the useless tedium And brew a cup of tea.  There is magic in its' fragrance, There is solace in its' taste; And then laden moments vanish Somehow into space.  And the world becomes a lovely thing! There's beauty as you'll see; All because you briefly stopped To brew a cup of tea.",
