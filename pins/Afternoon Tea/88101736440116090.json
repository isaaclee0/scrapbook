I normally do mine on a darker bread - pumpernickel or rye (cut the crust off) Rye, pumpernickel, & whole grain can also be purchased as Cocktail Breads loaves, which are really delish :^) You can use whipped or regular cream cheese (softened) with a ranch seasoning mix, mayo, dice the cucumber and mix in with spread or slice and use spread as a condiment.... you can season with mint, dill, pepper, tarragon or whatever suits your taste buds!",
