      "description": "Eccles Cakes were first commercially sold in 1793 in the town of Eccles near Manchester and are still popular today. Not really a cake, it is a lovely puff pastry pocket filled with currants, peel, and love.  My adaptation on the classic recipe takes out some of the sugar and fat but leaves the lovely taste.   This link also gives you hosting ideas for a tea party for mum and/the other women in your life.",
