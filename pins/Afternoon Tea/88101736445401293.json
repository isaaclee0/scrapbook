      "description": "These aren't your mama's Cucumber Finger Sandwiches! These sandies are a twist on the classic baby and bridal shower finger food. Instead of the traditional mayonnaise-based spread, this recipe calls for a whipped feta and cream cheese spread, studded with dill. Cut your thinly sliced bread into the desired shape, slather with the whipped feta and cream cheese spread, top with a English cucumber slice, sprinkle with dill, and you're good to go!",
