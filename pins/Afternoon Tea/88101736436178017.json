      "description": "A regional variation of the crumpet is the pikelet, whose name derives from the Welsh bara piglydd or \"pitchy [i.e. dark or sticky] bread\", later shortened simply to piglydd.  The main distinguishing feature of the Welsh or West Midlands pikelet is that it was traditionally cooked without a ring, with an end result rather flatter or thinner than a crumpet.",
