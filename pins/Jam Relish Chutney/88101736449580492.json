      "description": "This is the best selling, fabulous tasting, world famous  Tomato Relish as made by the Boonooroo Brown Paper-bag Ladies This is REALLY like granma used to make.  If I buy cooking tomatoes and they are very pale, I add a small tub of tomato paste.  You can add garlic, or herbs to this recipe, but I dont find it needs it. I always double this recipe, cause I am constantly being asked for it :) I use good quality brown vinegar, but the my fellow Bag Ladies use the generic stuff.",
