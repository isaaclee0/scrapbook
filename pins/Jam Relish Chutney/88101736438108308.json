      "description": "It Does!  it tastes like honey.  Going through Grandma's things I found a small scrap of paper with a recipe for Corn Cob Jelly.  I thought what? but since Grandma had saved it all those years (she was 93 when she passed over) that small scrap of paper - I decided to try it.  This looks to be the same recipe.  I took it and some fresh baked rolls (still warm) to an early morning meeting and every one asked why I had honey in a small canning jar.  I just smiled..... and went on with the meeting.",
