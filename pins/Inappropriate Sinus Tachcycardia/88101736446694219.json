A lot has changed in the past five years, so here is what an average day looks like for me now. This is neither a \"good day\" nor a \"bad day.\" On good days I can do more than what you see here, though I may pay for it the next day. On bad days I struggle a lot, and I have to pretty much stay in bed.",
