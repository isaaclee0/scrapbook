      "description": "Brooder box in coop with nesting box below. I just built a permanent brooder box in my coop, and I was in love with it, until I saw the great use of vertical real estate used here. I am certain I will dismantle it eventually so I can raise it up and add nests below. I put my chicks in the coop brooder at 4 weeks and keep a lamp on them for an additional two weeks. This design Makes so much sense. <3 this idea to the moon and back.",
