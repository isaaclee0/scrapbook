Restricted fascia reduces or stops the flow of nutrients to and waste away from our cells. This is called respiration. Respiration is essential to cellular function. If our cells can't function properly, they can become ineffective or even die. When ineffective, they can behave improperly or mutate. www.FasciaBlaster.com",
