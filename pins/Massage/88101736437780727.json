      "description": "Serratus anterior muscle is multipennate - that means it has several heads (or insertions) into the ribs and hence can have several trigger points simultaneously. It rotates scapula (shoulder blade) for abduction and flexion of arm. It also protracts scapula (pulls it forward on chest wall and holds it closely to chest wall), facilitating pushing movements such as push-ups or punching. Serratus anterior trigger points respond very well to hands-on treatments, self help balls and stretching.",
