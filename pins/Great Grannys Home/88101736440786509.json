      "description": "She made about five loaves of bread in each batch. She made them at least weekly and maybe twice a week when more of us children were at home. I remember her baking bread in the old coal burning kitchen stove back in the 1940s. We used to lean on it and eventually the round bar across the front became bowed inward from our weight over the years.",
