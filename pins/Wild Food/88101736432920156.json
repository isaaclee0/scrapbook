      "description": "Fried dandelion flowers and leaves. Make sure to pick dandelions that have not been sprayed! Wash thoroughly to remove any bugs.The batter consists of flour, baking powder, rice milk, and seasoning (I used Old Bay). Mix the ingredients together so that you get the consistency of pancake batter (sorry, I didn't measure!). Dip flowers and leaves in batter and drop into hot olive oil until golden brown. Let cool on paper towel to drain excess oil, then enjoy!",
