      "description": "Rose hip oil (which smells nothing like roses!) helps reduce scarring and stretch marks, and it is also known as a potent anti-aging treatment to help with wrinkles and fine lines. A rich source of vitamin A plus Omega 6 and Omega 3 essential fatty acids, rosehip oil is light and non greasy. More pins on rosehip oil on my anti-aging board for baby boomers.",
