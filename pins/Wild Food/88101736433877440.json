      "description": "Plantain offers many health benefits and is one of the top three common medicinal herbs along with dandelion and chicory.  Most plantain plants have leaves with veins that fork outward from a central midrib. Plantain does not have a blossom, it only has a compact seed head that shoots upward and turns from green to brown as the seeds mature. Plantain is both edible and medicinal, and it is a first-choice remedy for many skin ailments. All parts of the plant, including the seeds, are usable.",
