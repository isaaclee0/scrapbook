      "description": "The leaves of the Cleavers plant ( Galium aparine ) have small hooked hairs that cause it to “cleave” to the fingers when touched, hence the name. Used as a flavoring in soups and stews. Roasted seeds are used as a coffee substitute. Cleavers is primarily used for urinary problems and fluid retention. Recommended for enlarged lymph nodes, tonsillitis, hepatitis, and snake bites. Herbal mixtures treat bladder problems, including bladder infections, kidney stones, and prostatitis.",
