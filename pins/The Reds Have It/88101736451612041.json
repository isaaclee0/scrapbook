      "description": "Cleo Woodwork is the pilot of the USS Module. She's a little shy when you don't know but once you get to know her, she's crazy and fun, using the few words she says to make people laugh, she loves her job and takes after her father. She's extremely intelligent and doesn't pay very much attention to the rules, she respects them but usually doesn't listen to them.",
