      "description": "9 Dog Breeds That Love Children  The Irish setter is an active dog, longing to be in your company. It gets  on pretty well with children and will never give up on time well-spent  with any member of the family. A child at school age and an Irish setter  make a perfect match! Itâ€™s also a good choice if you have a baby but  the inexhaustible energy of theirs might become a little overwhelming  for the toddler.",
