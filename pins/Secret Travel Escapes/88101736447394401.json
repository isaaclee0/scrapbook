Here you'll find the land of castles, black and white Tudor villages, the Mappa Mundi and cider making. Don't think it's all about the chill though. There's a big festival scene, off-roading, whitewater rapids and lots of walking trails and rambles. Come and check out this beautiful corner of England.",
