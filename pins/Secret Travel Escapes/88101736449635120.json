      "description": "MaryJane, the pioneer of the glamping concept, opened the first B in the U.S. that offered wall-tent accommodations. Borrowing from her Forest Service past, in which she lived in a wall tent year-round, 27 miles from the end of a dirt road in the heart of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, she decided to share the experience with others by inviting guests to her farm in 2005. Five tents, nestled in a 100-year-old plum and walnut orchard on her Idaho organic farm, offer guests a unique getaway.",
