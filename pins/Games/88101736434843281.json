Girls Camp - (Pinner Says: As a kid I went to a friend’s birthday party where her mom did something similar–except, each skein of yarn was wrapped around the room individually, leading to personalized gift bags. It was a giant maze that forced everyone to crawl all around, under and over each other to follow our trail. She tied the end opposite of the gift bag to a TP roll, so that we could wind up the yarn as we went. It was a blast!)",
