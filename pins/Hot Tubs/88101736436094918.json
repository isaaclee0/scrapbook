I can't afford a swimming pool, but here in Texas when it's 100+ degrees out, it would be really nice to be able to lounge in a nice cold tub and read a book, drink some cold beer, and just chill. Can you picture this under the stars? Gotta have 2 tubs side by side. One for me, and one for my honey. :)",
