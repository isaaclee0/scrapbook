      "description": "Bereaved Fathers...When a child dies, the attention of friends and family is usually focused on the mother, while the father is expected to be strong and be the rock of the family. This is in part due the expectations of society and in part to the difference in grieving styles of men and women. Women in general grieve more openly while men tend to grieve privately. For this reason they are often referred to as the “forgotten mourners”.",
