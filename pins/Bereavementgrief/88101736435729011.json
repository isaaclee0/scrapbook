      "description": "One reviewer said: Having studied the subjects of suffering, grief, and loss over the years I've read countless books by an array of Christian writers. God's Healing for Life's Losses surpasses them all. It is by far the most condensed and concise book on grieving biblically that I've ever read. In my opinion it is also the most helpful.",
