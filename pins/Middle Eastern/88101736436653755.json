      "description": "Sohan Asali - Persian Honey and Saffron Almond candy. So incredibly easy! I eat them with Persian tea, and actually cut back the amount of saffron as if you are using good quality saffron, it can easily become overwhelming. I actually steeped saffron in rosewater, as overcooked rosewater loses its fragrance. and then added it AFTER I added the almonds.",
