      "description": "Roz Maaamar is an Egyptian Rice dish thats cooked in the oven rather than the stove top. Its creamy because of the milk and can be eaten savoury or sweet. My Family likes it with sugar however some people add salt and pepper. This is really delicious way of cooking rice and looks wonderful on the tablespread.",
