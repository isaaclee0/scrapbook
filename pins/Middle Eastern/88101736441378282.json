      "description": "Kabsa... yes, it's meat with rice and spices. Okay, so that sounds like every recipe in the Middle East, but this one is special. What makes it special is the Kabsa spice mix... saffron, cardamom, cinnamon, allspice, white pepper, and ground dried limes. Yes, I said it. Ground dried limes. This mix with the lamb and onions (you know how I feel about those) are simply fantastic. Great hearty recipe for a hungry family.",
