      "description": "The orange-bellied parrot (Neophema chrysogaster) is a small bird native to Australia. It was once widespread, but is now only seen in a shrinking area in the southeast. The males are bright yellow, orange, grain, and blue, while those colors in females are somewhat muted. The orange-bellied parrot is listed as “critically endangered” because it only breeds in one place- Melaleuca, in Tasmania. Numbers have declined in recent years, and there may be as few as 50 individuals remaining in the wild",
