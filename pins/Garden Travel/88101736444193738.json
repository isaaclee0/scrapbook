      "description": "Les Jardins de Cadiot - The English Garden is situated on a terrace which overlooks the Rose Garden and the Maze. Along its length a collection of conifers of different shapes and colours – emerald greens, yellow and blue greens – have been planted to act as a backdrop. It has been inspired by the great, innovative English gardeners of the late 19th and early 20th century – William Robinson and Gertrud Jekyll.",
