      "description": "Since I started the Jacket Society blog and womens Jacket line back in August of 2013, I have been working from home. This has been a big transition for me since prior to that I had a full time job that I had to be in an office daily and dress accordingly. Actually most of my life I have had that kind of a job schedule and quite frankly I liked that schedule with the exception of a few years when my son was young and I felt I was missing out on his growing up.Â As you all know when",
