      "description": "No matter what your title is - youth pastor, student minister, etc. - you are a disciple-maker. That is your calling, your task. And one of the primary things we do as disciple-makers is to facilitate encounters with God. We create environments and interactions where students are brought into proximity with God, with the intent that He transforms them.",
