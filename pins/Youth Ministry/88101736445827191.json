      "description": "Game: Clothespin Insanity.  We played several variations over a couple of rounds.  In this video the object was to clip your clothespin to someone, and not get any clipped on you.  We set each round to music- when the music stops the round is over.  Another variation had students starting out with 5 pins and stealing pins from others with the goal of having the most on you by the end.  Have fun!",
