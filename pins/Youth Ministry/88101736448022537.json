      "description": "\" May we see our students ignited in their passions and service, but may that ignition come not from a momentary event, but from a constant and prevailing disposition of seeking after the Lord. May we help them to sit faithfully at the feet of Christ that they would loudly proclaim with Peter and John, “As for us, we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard.” (Acts 4:20)\"",
