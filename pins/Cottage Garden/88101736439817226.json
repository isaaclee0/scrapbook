      "description": "What does angelonia have going for it? It blooms nonstop all summer long. It comes in blues and purples (my favorites), as well as pinks and whites. It holds up well in hot spots. It handles drought like a champ. It can grow in wet soil. I hear (never tried it myself, though), that you can even put it in a water garden. It attracts butterflies. Some varieties are fragrant. Deer and rabbits usually leave it alone.",
