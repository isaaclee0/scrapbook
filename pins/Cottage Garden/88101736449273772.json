      "description": "Chinch bugs can cause extensive damage to your lawn if left untreated. They live in the thatch layer of a lawn, where they feed on the grass by piercing the plant with their mouth and sucking the plant juices.  When chinch bugs feed, they release enzymes that facilitate easy feeding. The enzymes continue damaging the plant after feeding, and cause the grass to turn brown and potentially die.  Find out how to manage and recover from chinch bug damage on our blog.",
