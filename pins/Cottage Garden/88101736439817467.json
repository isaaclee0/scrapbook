      "description": "When choosing the material for your brick walkway, it is essential to consider the style you want to accentuate in your outdoor decor. Dark red bricks set in a sandy base create the impression of age. Additionally, the sand base ensures that the bricks will not move with drastic weather changes. This brick pathway fits in beautifully with the garden landscape, accentuating the timeworn and traditional feel./",
