      "description": "Climbing Hydrangea  Climbing hydrangea is a deciduous blooming vine that loves shade to partial shade and spreads vertically from 20 to 30 feet. Climbing hydrangeas grow best in well-drained rich soil. Their heart-shaped green leaves and clusters of large off-white flowers make it a striking vine to plant against the northern side of your home. Or, plant a climbing hydrangea next to a tall fence or a wooden arbor. It needs very little pruning and is almost disease-free.",
