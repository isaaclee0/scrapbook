      "description": "Climbing hydrangea vine:  Hydrangea anomala petiolaris is one of the best of the ornamental vines and useful because it will grow and flower even in a northern exposure. This is a large heavy vine that requires a very sturdy support. Though deciduous, it's reddish brown, peeling bark is attractive in the winter. Blooms in early summer and can reach 50' tall in sun or shade. Zones 4-8",
