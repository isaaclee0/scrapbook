The brick ensures that grass will not be matted down by a multitude of people wandering through the grounds. Here, the brick pathway leads around the garden to allow guests to take in the views. For an added treat, use small brick stepping stones to allow visitors to wander off the beaten path so they can enjoy even more breathtaking views./",
