      "description": "Want a plant to brighten a dull corner of your yard? This may be it! There hasn't been this much buzz about a plant in years! People have been clamouring for a re-blooming lilac for years and 'Bloomerang' delivers with a dense, compact plant with an intense mid May bloom followed by more deliciously fragrant bloom cones throughout the summer and fall, and it attracts butterflies, too! Mature ht 1.5 m (4 to 5 ft).",
