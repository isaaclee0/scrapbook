      "description": "Every cottage garden is unique to its gardener, but all have some things in common. A cottage garden, though small, is chockfull of a mixture of planting materials, including annuals, perennials, biennials, shrubs, vines and even herbs, vegetables and fruit trees. Cottage gardens historically were intended to be useful as well as beautiful. Such a garden is not intended to impress the viewer from afar, but to charm anyone who steps inside.",
