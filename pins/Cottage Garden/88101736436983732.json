      "description": "Hard to believe this is called The Ugly House, but it is! Situated in the heart of Snowdonia, Wales, it's currently a very charming little tea room. Some history (from the Snowdonia Society website): Legend tells us that it was a crude house built in the 15th century by two outlaw brothers. It was a ‘Ty Un Nos’ - or house built overnight. Under ancient law, he who built a house between sunset and sunrise, with walls, roof and smoking chimney, could claim the freehold.",
