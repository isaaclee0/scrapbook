      "description": "This getaway to @mackinacisle has taught me to slow down & take the back roads with the path less traveled. I found so much inspiration while traveling around the island this weekend from little cottages in the woods to Godâ€™s beautiful scenes. October is off to a great start... I hope yours is as well! I shared some lovely neutral fall decor on the blog today: LizMarieBlog.Com - link in my profile. I hope you enjoy!! #mackinacisland #mackinawisland #mymackinac #lmbloveshouses",
