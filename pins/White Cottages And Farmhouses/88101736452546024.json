      "description": "A happy customer up in the Hudson Valley area of New York sent us some lovely photos of their finished deVOL kitchen and home and we just couldn't resist sharing them with you all on the blog. This charming farmhouse has been renovated sympathetically and thoughtfully and our simple Shaker cupboards really couldn't have been a better fit, we're thrilled. #deVOLKitchens #HudsonValley #InteriorInspo Image by Angela Pham",
