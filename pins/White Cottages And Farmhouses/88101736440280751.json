      "description": "Traditional Exterior by Pasco Design | Federation style weatherboard. Federation-style architecture flourished during the budding national identity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Architects and builders fused influences from France, Britain and America to create a uniquely Australian style – less formal than its Victorian predecessors and far better suited to the country’s subtropical climate.",
