      "description": "Very fall-ish - great for a casual fall gathering. Natalie said this about planning the party - â€œThe dessert table consisted of homemade pies, Apple, Dutch Apple, Caramel Apple & Pumpkin pie. Other desserts included Caramel apples, pumpkin cookies, apple cider donuts & pumpkin fluff. I wanted to carry the Fall theme all the way through the party so I created a Chili Bar which consisted of Chili, Chili Mac, Chili Fries, Chili Dogs & Chili Baked Potatoes!\" AWESOME!",
