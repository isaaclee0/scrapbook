      "description": "Add a unique twist to your landscape with stepping stones that span your pond. Here, the stones are placed on cinder blocks that allow both people and pets to cross the pond. Match the stepping stones with the stones that surround the water, ensuring it all will blend beautifully. Choose the size of the stones based on the size of your water feature, while keeping safety in mind as well./",
