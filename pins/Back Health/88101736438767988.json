      "description": "A therapist must know this muscle group and its trigger points very well if they are to offer effective solutions to their clientâ€™s chest pain, upper back pain, shoulder pain, radiating arm pain or thoracic outlet syndrome, wrist pain, and hand pain complaints. The job of releasing Scalene trigger points is made more difficult by the somewhat hidden location of the muscle group and its proximity to many important nerve trunks and blood vessels in the neck region.",
