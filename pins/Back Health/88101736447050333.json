      "description": "How does one hip cause such misery? Stand in front of a mirror. Are your hips level? In the same horizontal plane? If they are, try hiking one hip up. What does that shoulder do? It drops down, but why? Well, the hips are the foundation of your upper body. If one hip is higher than the other, the first thing that happens is that both shoulders move to stay on top of the hips. Level those hips!",
