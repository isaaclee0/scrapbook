      "description": "Turns out that \"English Plum Pudding\" was also a favorite Thanksgiving dessert in  nineteenth-century New England. Don't think about those stolid plum puddings you've eaten or read about. This 1844 beauty is just as scrumptious as it looks. We tell you how to  make it on our blog, Cooking New England (Keith Stavely and Kathleen Fitzgerald). Revive an old tradition and make one for Thanksgiving this year!",
