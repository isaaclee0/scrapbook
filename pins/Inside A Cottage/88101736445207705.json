      "description": "Morning world ... Happy Tuesday to you all . Just back in from the packing room - was in there at 5.20 again. Having slept with Neddy Noo last night who along with Jack is full of cold and was running a temperature last night- he was asleep by 7pm and that's not Ned. Both tucked up in their beds and I'm waiting on them hand and foot as any mum would - hate them being poorly. I won't be back in the office today so if you ring I won't pick up - please email me. Have a splendid day Coll xxx...",
