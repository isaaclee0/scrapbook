      "description": "Farmhouse style decorating is a vintage country style that feels welcoming, relaxing, and cozy.  Farmhouses were not filled with lots of accessories that add clutter.  Practicality was very important, so everything needed to serve a purpose.  Things were built to be durable, not delicate.  Items in a farmhouse were typically not mass produced - they were hand made and often handed down from one generation to the next.  Here are a few ways to add farmhouse style to your home.",
