      "description": "Kids (and adults) refrigerator snack drawer all prepped thanks to the kids helping out today!  Various fruits and vegetables (shop the sales!) Rinsed & COMPLETELY let air dry before packing...if moisture is kept low then they should last refrigerated 5-6 days. Guacamole Hummus and Nut-Butters are ready-to-go for dip. We boiled & peeled several dozen eggs once completely cool seal the boiled eggs in containers of 2 or baggies & they last 5-7 days too! -Rachel by cleanfoodcrush",
