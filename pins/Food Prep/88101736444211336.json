      "description": "With a strategic (yet, easy) bi-monthly meal prep plan and about a zillion freezer bags, you can spend 2-3 hours cooking and preparing enough clean eating food for your toddler to have roughly two snacks and a lunch for five days a week. Three hours or less? That's the equivalent of a Tuesday/Thursday college class. Easy peasy, and much more fun.",
