      "description": "I love sharp cheddar cheese! This Paleo-Vegan cheese tastes almost exactly like Wisconsin cheddar, except it’s dairy-free. It is a firm, rich, creamy cheese, with a slightly tangy flavor. Delicious on crackers, slice it for sandwiches, grate it into salads and soups, or use it to make vegan cheese sauce for veggies. It is made with coconut butter, lemon and a few other secret ingredients you can find in any healthy grocery. It’s easy to make – just blend, chill, slice, and eat!",
