      "description": "Paesanella, from the Ciresa Family, is produced in the Val Taleggio, an Alpine valley of Lombardy, Italy â€” best known for its namesake cheese. The rind is pink and sticky, with a bit of sandy grit to it (a quality often seen in washed rinds, it comes from the deposit of minerals after repeated washes with a salty brine). The paste is soft and bulging, with a creamy texture and a mild barny pungency. In flavor it is sweet, meaty and full with mushroom and hay notes.",
