      "description": "Garlic and Chive Cheese is a fresh, pressed cheese. It can be made and eaten in the same day. It slices very nicely and makes a great addition to any cheese tray. This is a family favorite that all of my kids just loved. The cheese has a sweet, milky taste. Itâ€™s delicious as is or with crackers.",
