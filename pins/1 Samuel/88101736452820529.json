      "description": "1 Samuel 12:21 A bit of bible, a bit of prayer was created so that people could see a verse and a prayer together at the same time, as an encouragement to stop, absorb, and pray. It only takes a minute to connect with God. The results are priceless, because as we draw near to Him, He will draw near to us. Stop, absorb, and pray.
