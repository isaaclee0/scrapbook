      "description": "This slipcover was made from 3 full/queen sized quilts my customer purchased from Marshalls. Sewing the slipcover from quilts was easier than I originally thought. The quilted fabric stretched and conformed beautifully to the shape of the sofa. I pre-washed the quilts in HOT water and dried on a HOT setting. I recommended that the customer use a commercial size washing machine for future washings.",
