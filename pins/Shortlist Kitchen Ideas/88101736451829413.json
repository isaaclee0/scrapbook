      "description": "This prep table feels lighter and airier than your typical kitchen island, it's from our Classic English range and really is such a wonderful addition to any busy kitchen. The bottom is open and slatted which makes it perfect for big pots and pans and dishes, while the drawers are great for storing away smaller bits like crockery and plates. #deVOLKitchens #PrepTable #KitchenIsland #KitchenIslandIdeas",
