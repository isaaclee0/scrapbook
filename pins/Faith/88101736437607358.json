      "description": "When we lose a loved one, we long to have a confidence that they are standing in glory with Jesus. When there is little evidence of that left behind, it can be devastating for us. When you are gone, what are the traces of a life lived for Christ that your loved ones will see? What legacy will you leave that speaks to the love and confidence you have for Christ and your salvation? Your story can begin anew today and tell of God long after you are gone.",
