      "description": "\"In the 1520s, hundreds of Bibles, the first copies printed in English, were burned by the Roman Catholic Bishop of London. It was illegal to own and those who had copies faced execution. The Bibles were confiscated and burned by Roman authorities. The whole printing was bought up by the church and burned in St. Paul's by Bishop Cuthbert Tunstall.\"",
