      "description": "\"The Old Rugged Cross,\" one of the world's best loved hymns, was composed in Albion, Michigan in 1913 by the Reverend George Bennard (1873-1958). Pinner said:  The son of an Ohio coal miner, Bennard was a lifelong servant of God, chiefly in the Methodist ministry. He wrote the words and music of over three hundred other hymns. None achieved the fame of \"The Old Rugged Cross,\" the moving summation of his faith.",
