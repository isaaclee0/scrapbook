Tell a special needs parent that God chose them because \"He\" knew they can handle it... Please. I repeat: some parents are in intense pain. Some of that pain can even stem from religious beliefs that if they'd prayed more, were better Christians, if they'd lived more right, that they wouldn't have been... punished this way.",
