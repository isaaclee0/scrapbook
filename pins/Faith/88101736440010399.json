      "description": "The Bible answers the toughest of life’s questions including: “what is the meaning to life?\" Life does not climb towards happiness and meaning until you reach a pinnacle of happiness. Rather, the sun rises and the sun sets – day in and day out – there’s a boredom that can grow because of the mundane. We can use money and possessions to cope – but that’s all it is – coping. Then sometimes life throws us curve balls as we age and face trials. We have to fight for joy. Fight for meaning.",
