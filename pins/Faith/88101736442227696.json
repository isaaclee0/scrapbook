NOW my tv time is bible time , plus I pray more too. and the real shocker is to be without worldly tv for over a year now and to be at someones house who has worldly tv on just makes my heart ache the language the sex and all the stuff God hates that I never really noticed because I thought it was normal. TRY IT! and see.",
