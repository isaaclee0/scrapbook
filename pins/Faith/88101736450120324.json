      "description": "I remember the day I first learned about the magnitude of evil at work in this world. I was about 8 when the lady across the street, the mother of three of my friends, tried to commit suicide. She was a Jewish survivor of the Holocaust and had seen her entire family die in a concentration camp. Her 5-year-old daughter found her mother on the kitchen floor and ran to get the neighbor. Medics were able to save her life.  That's how I learned about the Holocaust. #blog",
