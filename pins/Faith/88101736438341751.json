      "description": "\"Most of us, when we are praying, think of the pancake on the stove which might burn. While making pancakes, we think how nice it would be to pass our time in prayer. While speaking with one man, we think how useful it would be to pass our time with another. We never do anything well. Only one thing can be done well at a time.\" Richard Wurmbrand, from \"Sermons in Solitary Confinement\" (founder of the Voice of the Martyrs)",
