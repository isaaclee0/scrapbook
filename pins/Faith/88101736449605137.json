Peters has a Master of Divinity and also a Master of Theology. Both from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. He is passionate about what the Word says and about opposing the people who twist it and take it out of context to serve themselves. He has great knowledge of the Word and on the Word of Faith movement.",
