      "description": "You may be going through a hard season of life, but learn to view hard seasons as seasons of training in disguise. Don't despise tough times... Instead let them develop strength, wisdom, endurance, humility, submission, courage, and grace in you. How you respond to and grow during challenging, tough seasons will determine the level God can promote and use you in the future. God is training you because He has a great plan and purpose for you. Let the training begin! // by andrearhowey, via Flickr",
