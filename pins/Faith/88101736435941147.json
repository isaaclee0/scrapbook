Alliance Pastor Jean Pierre Moukingui is empowered by the Holy Spirit when he cries for God to forgive the men who doused him and two other church leaders in diesel fuel and lit their feet on fire. After receiving medical treatment, the men returned to their village church, where they joined their church family to sing and praise the Lord.",
