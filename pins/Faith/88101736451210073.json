      "description": "“To pray is to love,” wrote St Augustine.The man who loves God, prays continually and with fervour, whereas the man who has little love for his Creator, prays rarely and apathetically.Prayer does not consist primarily in verbal expression but in the elevation of the mind to God in adoration, thanksgiving, propitiation and supplication.Love should be the inspiration of our communication with God, for where there is no love, there can be no prayer.#mypic",
