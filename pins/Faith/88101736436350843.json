      "description": "This is Jacob's Well -- Bir Ya'qub -- where Jesus encountered a Samaritan woman and discussed the spiritual \"water\" which quenches forever the deepest thirst (John 4:1-42) .This well, from which Jesus once asked a drink, is fed by underground springs, and its water is fresh and cool. Because the water is moving and not from a cistern, the ancients called it \"living water\" -- a term to which Jesus gave a new and special meaning. He said HE is the living water!",
