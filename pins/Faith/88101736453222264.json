Colossians 2:6–7, Hebrews 6:18–19a God has given us His promise. His oath. When we run to Him for refuge He will shelter us. We are secure in Him because He is trustworthy and true. He will give us everything we need to get through today and that means you and I have nothing to worry about. Absolutely nothing!",
