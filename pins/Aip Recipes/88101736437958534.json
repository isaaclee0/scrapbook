      "description": "Yes. You can freeze cauliflower rice: I'm a new convert to cauliflower rice â€” the-starch-that-is-really-a-vegetable. In my mind it's not a poor substitute for couscous or rice; it is its own thing, and a really satisfying and healthy base for pasta sauces and stir-fries.   \t  So imagine my delight when I realized you can freeze cauliflower rice. It means that making a batch of this good stuff can be even easier than opening a box of pasta.",
