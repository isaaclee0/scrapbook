      "description": "From Italian-based furniture maker Florida comes this utterly brilliant Letto Zip bed which features a top cocoon-like cover that can be removed at night for sleeping, but easily zipped back on in the morning to hide the disheveled, unmade mess of sheets. Available in white, blue or gray, the bed’s rounded, padded frame definitely gives it a slick not-too-distant-future appearance, particularly when it’s all zipped up.",
