Also, use less-perfumed suds; the perfumes, especially floral scents, can cause allergic reactions. â€¢ It's important to take proper care of your clothespins and keep them clean. Place them in a mesh bag, swish in a bucket of warm, soapy water, rinse thoroughly and hang the entire bag on the line to dry.",
