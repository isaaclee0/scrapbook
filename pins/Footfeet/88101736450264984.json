      "description": "Tarsal tunnel syndrome causes a burning pain in the foot, with pins and needles or numbness, which may radiate into the arch of the foot. It is caused by pressure on a nerve which passes along a tunnel called the tarsal tunnel, on the inside of the ankle. Treatment involves rest, correcting foot biomechanics and exercises.",
