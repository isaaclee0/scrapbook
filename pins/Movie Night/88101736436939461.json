      "description": "In 2003, The Redlight Children Campaign and Priority Films joined forces to launch the most comprehensive film project about child trafficking to date. Holly is the project's center film, a gripping story based on the writer's real-life experiences in Cambodia. Patrick (Ron Livingston of Sex and the City) is an American stolen artifacts dealer living in Cambodia, comfortable numb with the country's realities. Then he meets Holly, a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl who has just been sold.",
