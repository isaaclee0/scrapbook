      "description": "First Do No Harm is based on the  true story of the film's director Jim Abrahams' son, whose severe epilepsy, unresponsive to medications, many of which came w/  terrible side effects, is controlled by the ketogenic diet. The \"Seizure Diet\" was first developed at the Mayo Clinic, & then put into regular use at Johns Hopkins. A must watch for anyone who is, or knows someone suffering with seizures. It closely resembles the Modified Atkins Diet, however there are books devoted to just this diet.",
