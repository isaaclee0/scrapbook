      "description": "2013 is the 70th Anniversary of the Execution of Sophie Scholl (1921-1943). Sophie Scholl was a 21 year old German woman executed by the Nazis for distributing anti-Nazi pamphlets. Prison officials, in later describing the scene, emphasized the courage with which she walked to her execution. Her last words were: \"How can we expect righteousness to prevail when there is hardly anyone willing to offer themselves up individually for a righteous cause? Such a fine, sunny day, and I have to go.\"",
