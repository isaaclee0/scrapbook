      "description": "Set in Donegal, Ireland during the Great Famine of 1846, Joe, Mark, Paul and Stephen McGann portray the hardworking sons of the Phelan family - two farmers, a schoolteacher and a priest - in a tragic period drama inspired by their search for their Irish roots. Enforced by the English landowner's agent, Captain Townsend (Michael Kitchen), the injustices of the landholding system combine with the onset of the potato blight to devastate their community and divide the four Phelan brothers between nonviolent protest and bloody revolt. Faced with impending starvation, one brother takes the law into his own hands.",
