Both of those are cruel practices that will result in a lot of unnecessary pain and suffering for your lovely chickens. Rather, this article is about simple grooming, much like how you’d make sure to clip your dog’s claws now and then to keep them short, or file your own finger nails back to keep them from getting in your way.",
