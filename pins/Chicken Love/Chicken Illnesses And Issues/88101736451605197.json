      "description": "A chicken's feathers should be shiny & lay flat against the body. They should not be broken, ruffled, bloody, frayed or tattered, which could indicate behavioral problems in the flock, stress, parasites, a nutrition deficit or rodent problems. Know what molting looks like and the age and season to expect it as well as what pin feathers look like. Frizzle feathered breeds are an exception to the flat feather rule.",
