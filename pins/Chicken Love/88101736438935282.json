      "description": "How To Build a Trouble-Free Chicken Brooder -this is a great idea!  Easy to clean, wire is high enough so chicks can stay in brooder until they feather out. You could support the wire mesh with some 1X2's every few feet, and put a cross piece from one side to the other to suspend a heat lamp.  I would use a plastic fencing material because it wouldn't be as \"sharp\" to work with, wouldn't rust and could be disassembled easily for storage or you could reuse it outside for a small enclosure.",
