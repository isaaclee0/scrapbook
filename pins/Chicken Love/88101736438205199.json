      "description": "CHICKEN TUNNELS   Bruce has created a modular system where he links a series of wired chicken “tunnels” together to direct his chickens to areas in his garden that needs some serious work. The chickens go through the tunnels to the weed infested area and over the course of a few weeks, scratch and dig and fertilize the spot and get it ready for his vegetable seedlings.",
