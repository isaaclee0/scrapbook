      "description": "Padua-  vegetable garden, the farmyard and the vineyard.  Paduan hens are an ancient breed  of small crested and bearded chickens from Padova. The Paduan hen is distinguished by the splendor of its plumage and elegant form. The crest is replaced by a tuft of long feathers on the head, which gives the appearance of a chrysanthemum flower in the male or of a hydrangea in the female.",
