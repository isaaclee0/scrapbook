      "description": "\" Ode to Chickahominy After Tasha passed away in June 2008, Chickahominy went to live with Amy and Winslow, where he spent considerable time in the summer cruising around the gardens with the bantam hen Annadama, and later her brood of fluffy chicks. He did miss Tasha, however, and occasionally headed through the woods to her house around four in the afternoon. Perhaps he hoped to find her on the front porch having tea. Chickahominy passed away last November. He was fourteen years old.\"",
