      "description": "This is a chicken's oil gland, (aka: uropygial gland or preen gland) which resides at the top of the tail.  When I saw one for the first time I thought my rooster had some sort of tumor. You will see your chickens reaching around to the back of their tails with their beaks when preening their feathers, particularly after a dust bath. Cool, huh?",
