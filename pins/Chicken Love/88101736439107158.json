      "description": "We have never had any problems with respiratory infections or other illness in our flock either, and I think it is due in large part to how strong our chickens' immune systems are because of what they are fed. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, for chickens as well as for people, and my girls get this custom mix every morning before they get any treats.",
