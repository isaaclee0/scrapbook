      "description": "Groninger Meeuwen hens. This Dutch breed is related to the Fresian but is around 25% larger, with the males weighing around 2.5 kilograms (6 pounds). They are excellent foragers and good winter layers. They were nearly extinct in 1980, with only 26 birds left, but fortunately a group of poultry enthusiasts in The Netherlands took notice of the breed and have brought it back.",
