      "description": "Addison's Disease.  Insidious and usually progressive hypofunctioning of the adrenal cortex.  Both mineralcorticoids and glucocorticoids are deficient.  Symptoms most often include hyperpigmentation and hypotension. Adrenal crisis can manifest as asthenia, severe lower body pain, peripheral vascular collapse, and (if allowed to progress) renal shut down. Many patients who lose adrenal function appear fine, but experience crisis when under physiologic stress; shock and fever may be only signs.",
