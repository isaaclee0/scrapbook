      "description": "Jane Austen had contracted Addisons Disease. By May 1817 she was so ill that she and her sister, Cassandra, to be near Jane's physician, rented rooms in Winchester. Tragically, there was then no cure and Jane Austen died in her sister's arms in the early hours of 18 July, 1817. She was 41 years old. She is buried in Winchester Cathedral.
