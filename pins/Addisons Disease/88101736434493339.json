      "description": "Symptoms of adrenal fatigue include the following: a thick tongue with a heavy coating, dark circles under the eyes and thin fingernails. Another strong indicator that the adrenal glands are not working properly is when the blood pressure drops 10 points or more from lying down to a standing position, this is called orthostatic hypertension. When left untreated, adrenal fatigue can escalate into other chronic problems such as obesity (the most common), thyroid disorders and cancer.",
