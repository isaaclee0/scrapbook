      "description": "I need this in my life... The Bed Fan delivers a cool breeze between the sheets--without AC costs, and without disturbing your partner. The fan attaches to the foot of the bed and quietly blows fresh, cool air between your top and bottom sheets, instantly dispersing built-up body heat trapped under the covers and moving up to 100 cubic feet of air every minute. It's more effective than traditional cooling methods, which only affect the air outside the bed!",
