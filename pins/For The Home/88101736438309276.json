      "description": "Biochemist Daniel Nocera invented the \"artificial leaf,\" a silicon wafer that imitates real leaves by creating energy from sunlight and water. When the you put the wafer in water, it splits the hydrogen and oxygen, and collects the hydrogen in a fuel cell. One artificial leaf placed in a quart of water provides up to 100 watts of energy, 24 hours a day.
