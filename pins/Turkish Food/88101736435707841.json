      "description": "Dal With Poached Eggs, Cilantro and Yogurt by Amaryll Schwertner, wsj: Dal, an aromatic, soupy stew, is a staple of the India. Made with legumes that have been flavored with peppy spices ( like ginger and coriander), it's often eaten plain or spooned over basmati rice. Here, a thick red lentil dal is brightened with tart plain yogurt and fresh cilantro leaves. A flavorful dish whose crowning glory is a pair of just-set poached eggs, it makes India's go to food ideal for brunch. #Dal #Eggs",
