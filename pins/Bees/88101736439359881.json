      "description": "Hex Hive - similar to Langstroth, only the boxes are hexagon, imitating both a hollow log, and the shape of the honey comb.  The theory is that this is a more natural setting, thus making more docile and healthy bees. Also, the frames are open, allowing the bees to make their own comb, which will further promote a healthy, natural hive.",
