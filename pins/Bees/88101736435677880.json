      "description": "In the 1950â€²s, the honeybee population numbered 5 million strong, while today despite the advent of improved farming methods and technology, the bee population has dwindled to 2.5 million. A significant loss considering that one out of every three bites of food has been pollinated by a honeybee.  What has brought us to this point? And more importantly, what can we do about it?",
