      "description": "Mating occurs in flight over ten meters above ground. The young queen, born five to six days earlier, has only ventured out of the hive for her reconnaissance flight.   When sexually mature, she leaves the hive on a fair windless day and mates with about a dozen males to fill her spermatheca. Mating results in death for the drones.",
