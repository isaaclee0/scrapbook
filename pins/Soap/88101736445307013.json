      "description": "For a thicker hand soap, this really is a great way. Just please a GLASS bowl and NEVER plastic. Always use organic soap bars (I use Dr. Bronner's) and high quality essential oils. (A few drops goes a long way! ) Thieves is a natural antimicrobial. I love rosemary, too. You can add some pure organic sweet almond oil or neem oil the next day along with the essential oil. Test your skin for sensitivity, first.",
