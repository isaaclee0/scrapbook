      "description": "Mister Hotpot in Brooklyn's Chinatown, a Fujianese joint. Hot pot is the only meal. The are two broths at Mister Hotpot: a spicy one with lots of chili peppers, Sichuan peppercorns, and a not-spicy one. You can order one broth or split the pot and get both. It's that \"special broth,\" made with pork bones and various spicesâ€”cinnamon, star anise, and a more esoteric Chinese spice called cai guo, that will outperform most. It is the most important thing about Mister Hotpot.",
