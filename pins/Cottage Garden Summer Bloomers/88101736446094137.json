      "description": "Mallow, Looking like a miniature hollyhock, malva produces pretty flower spikes in blue, pink, purple, or white. It also has attractive heart-shape foliage and is useful among shrubs, in wild gardens, and in mixed borders.  These short-lived plants self-seed but generally do not become invasive. Staking may be required in windy places. Mallows are not fussy about soil, but they do need full sun to do well.",
