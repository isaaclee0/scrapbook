      "description": "Once found growing wild on the American prairie, coneflowers are now one of the most widely grown and hybridized perennials in the country. Beside single-flowering forms there are also doubles and even triple, petal-packed varieties you can grow. Colors vary from the traditional purple to white, orange, yellow, and red. Coneflowers grow best in full sun, but will tolerate some light shade. They bloom from early summer to fall and are attractive to birds and butterflies. Grows in Zones 3-9./",
