      "description": "Allium ‘Millenium’ is a versatile perennial for a sunny garden because of its compact upright habit and resistance to all types of pests. It is also drought tolerant and loved by butterflies and bees. Though the fragrant blooms are very attractive in midsummer, the seed heads are the real floral feature. They last for several months, providing interest in the garden until late winter.",
