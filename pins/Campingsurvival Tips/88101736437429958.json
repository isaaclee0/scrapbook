      "description": "We make these EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. we go camping. They are SO good-- nothing tastes better after a long night of being cold and hungry. The kids love them because they can make them however they want and I love them because clean-up is virtually non-existent! You just can't lose with these. Also great for REUNIONS! You can whip up big batches at one time!",
