      "description": "Use 3 to 5 tea lights under a slow cooker pot / crockpot to heat your room. I have tried flowerpot, plantpot heaters and this is way better. Throws out a lot more heat, doesn't smell like some clay ones tend to do, plus you don't have to mess about with multiple pots or nuts and bolts. I used a small crock 1.5ltr which gave out loads of heat. Give it a try. You will be surprised how well it works. Ideal if you have power cuts / power outages.",
