      "description": "Shelters are particularly important in cold or rough weather or when you must  remain in an area for a prolonged period of time. Good shelter should:  • Protect you from the wind and the elements.  • Be easily built to conserve energy.  • Be easily and adequately ventilated.  • Be large enough to be comfortable but small enough to heat easily.  • The better your shelter, the less energy lost in compensating for its  inadequacies.",
