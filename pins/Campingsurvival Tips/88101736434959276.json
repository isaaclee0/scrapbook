      "description": "When a natural disaster or other emergency strikes, be prepared to have plenty of fresh drinking water on hand with the cool new water BOB. Rather than temporarily filling up an open bathtub with water that could easily get contaminated or leak down the drain, just lay this innovative heavy duty food grade FDA approved plastic bladder out in any standard bathtub, attach the fill sock to the faucet and fill to capacity In about 20 minutes you'll have 100 gallons",
