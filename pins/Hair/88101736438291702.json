      "description": "Avoid the triangle look; this happens when your curls weigh the roots of your hair down and it creates flatness at the top and bulk at the bottom, resulting in your hair looking like a Christmas tree. Make sure you have a good hairdresser that knows curly hair, and knows proper techniques such as slicing and angling the layers down to reduce bulk. Cut curls at the end of each \"S.\" Try styling and washing upside down, as well as clipping up the roots with clips to get more root lift.",
