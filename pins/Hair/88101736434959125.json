Twist the braid away from your face and then twist the flat iron onto your hair in the same direction your hair is twisted. Do not touch rubberband or else you will get that weird crease. Repeat this process twice! After hair is cooled, then take them out and run your fingers through the braid. Saw this on Rachel Ray Show. It gives you nice beachy waves!",
