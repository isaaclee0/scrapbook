Easy 2nd day hair and it takes 5 minutes, so great for the #lazydaysofsummer. I used #PuffCuffs for my bun. I give them üëçüëç; I don‚Äôt have to worry about breakage with these!\"‚†Ä ‚†Ä The calendar says Fall but the heat says \"It's still Summa!\" ‚òÄÔ∏èü•µThank goodness for Puffcuff. ‚†Ä ‚†Ä üì∏ @amym_will on IG",
