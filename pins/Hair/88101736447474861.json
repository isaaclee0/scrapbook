      "description": "Pomade adds control and tames the frizzies. If your hair is long, use on the roots only.  Wax gives intense control, which is especially important for short to medium-length styles.  Shine enhancers often contain silicone, which helps all hair types look smoother and shinier.  Flexible hair sprays set a style while allowing you to brush and restyle throughout the day.",
