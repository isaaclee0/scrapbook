      "description": "Types of Redheads. You see a lot of colors mislabeled as red hair shades on the internet these days. A warm blonde or a warm light brown is not strawberry blonde. Real strawberry blonde has a light orange cast. Real red hair does not have a cool tone. Burgundy is not red - that's a man-made color. Warm dark brown is not auburn (though you'll see lots of women trying to claim that it is.) To qualify as red, you have to have more red tones in your hair than any other.",
