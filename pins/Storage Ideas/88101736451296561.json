      "description": "This is right up my alley since I’m not keen on taking up storage space in my garage. A few short 2x4’s, screws, and some clothes line is all you need to get your wheelbarrow up off the ground and stored along a fence or outside garage wall to create your own holder. This is especially handy to keep from having to move the wheelbarrow every time you need access to the area.",
