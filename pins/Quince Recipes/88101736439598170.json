      "description": "Have you ever made a fruit liqueur or cordial? I never have, but I recently came into possession of two very nice quince fruits, and I wanted to hold on to their flavor as long as possible. We have had poor luck with quince, here at The Kitchn, and I wanted to do something long-lasting and relatively foolproof.   So when I came across a recipe for quince ratafia in Jane Grigson's Good Things, I was intrigued.",
