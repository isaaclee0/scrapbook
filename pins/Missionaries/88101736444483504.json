      "description": "Lottie Moon - mastered the Chinese language, became an admirer of Chinese culture and history, and started wearing Chinese clothes and adopted many of their customs. When China was facing plague, famine, revolution, and war, Moon shared her personal finances and food with anyone in need around her. She died of starvation in the harbor of Kobe, Japan, while en route back to the United States.  She was a small lady with a huge heart for the lost. Crazy, beautiful person. :)",
