      "description": "This is a picture of Katie Davis and her fourteen adopted daughters. Katie Davis has done, not just one, but many brave things. Katie left a promising future in America to become a missionary in Uganda. Today she runs a non-profit organization called Amazima, which means truth in the Lugandan language. This ministry seeks to meet the physical, emotional, and spiritual needs of the people of Uganda. “Jesus does not ask that we care for the less fortunate, he demands it.” #OneBraveThing",
