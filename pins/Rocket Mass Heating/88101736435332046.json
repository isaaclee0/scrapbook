      "description": "With this rocket stove you burn about two cords of wood per year. You can burn a fire for four hours a night, burning approximately a 12” X 18” stack of wood and have heat radiating for over 30 hours. This reduces heating bills in winter to a fraction of what they cost with contemporary furnace systems.",
