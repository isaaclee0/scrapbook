      "description": ". . Hey IG buds. I’ve been on hiatus for awhile. Between playing nurse mate to a dying buddy, my Mr. coming home for a week, graduation and wedding parties I’ve been nominated to help decorate/cater, yard work and flower beds, there’s not a lot of time left. . . Just want you to know I do see you guys, I unwind in the evenings and get my eye candy fix. Thanks for keeping me grounded. . . #realsimplestyle #farmhousesimple #vintageporchlovesvintage #ihatecancer",
