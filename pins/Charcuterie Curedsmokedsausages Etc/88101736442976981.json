      "description": "These traditional English sausages are spicy And so much better than the shop bought varieties. If you can get hold of sausage skins or casings, so much the better - but these sausages still taste great without them. They are great for breakfast, brunch, picnics, casseroles or a firm family favourite - Bangers And Mash! Try and use local organically produced pork for a superior flavour.They can be frozen before cooking And the mixture can be used for sausagemeat stuffing also.",
