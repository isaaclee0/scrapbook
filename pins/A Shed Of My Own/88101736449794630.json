      "description": "Michelle created her tiny, 18-inch-deep garden shed by co-opting space from her garage behind her Mill Valley, California, home.

But it was time to update the look: “I wanted to paint the shed a single color because a uniform backdrop makes it easier to organize all the tools and pots and accessories in a garden shed,” she says.",
