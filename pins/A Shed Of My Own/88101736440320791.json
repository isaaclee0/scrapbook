      "description": "As a wedding gift, Heather Cameron's husband, Kevin, took apart a neglected potting shed on their property and rebuilt it into a greenhouse with a tempered-glass roof. \"I watched the whole process, but loved that I didn't have to do a thing,\" says Heather. \"Kevin built exactly what I had envisioned.\" Peach trees and Concord grapevines shade the 10- by 12-foot greenhouse, and raised beds of carrots, corn, beets, and dill line the path to the door.   - CountryLiving.com",
