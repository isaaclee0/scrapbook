      "description": "This lovely example of a Felbrigg, one of our National Trust range of garden sheds, has pride of place in our customer's well established Bedford garden. It is due to be used for the storage of gardening equipment and tools. In line with the entire range, this shed is finished in vertically sawn FSC Certified timber boards which provides more of a traditional look and feel to the shed.",
