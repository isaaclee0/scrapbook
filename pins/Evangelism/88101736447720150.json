      "description": "\"Many of our students may have experienced whispers of conviction (because they know they aren’t perfect), but without repentance there is no salvation. In every Protestant understanding of the “Order of Salvation” (Ordo Salutis), Repentance always comes before Justification. Yet there have been too many times when I’ve heard speakers (usually at Christian camps and retreats) proclaim an invitation to receive the promise of the gospel without clearly calling students to repentance.\"",
