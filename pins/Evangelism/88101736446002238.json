      "description": "\"The following method of witnessing to those lost in bible-based cults is non-offensive and powerful. It focuses on Jesus, the gospel, and uses Scripture. This is important for three reasons:  1st, Jesus draws all men to Himself (John 12:32);  2nd, the Gospel is powerful for salvation (Rom. 1:16); & 3rd, Gods Word accomplishes what God wants it to (Isaiah 55:11).\"   #adult #collegelife #church #college #living #spiritual #youthgroup #study #friends #family #howto #witness #evangelism #mormon",
