He has been described as \"one of America's most influential evangelicals\". He blogs on his website and hosts \"The Briefing,\" a daily podcast on current events from the Christian perspective. As a Calvinist, Mohler believes that human salvation is a free gift from God which cannot be earned by human action or will.",
