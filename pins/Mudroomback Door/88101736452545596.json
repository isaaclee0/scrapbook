      "description": "The boot room was also designed very specifically around its purpose.  Not only is it a barrier between house and garden, where boots and coats can be left, but itâ€™s also both the utility and laundry room and houses another large fridge. The cupboards, shelves and pigeon-holes were designed as a space-efficient storage system that packs a great deal of purpose into a relatively compact space. Here too, everything has its place and order can be kept, or restored, with minimal effort. ",
