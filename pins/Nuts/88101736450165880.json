      "description": "My inspiration to develop this recipe was a combination of our Nutrition and Content Director wanting a sheet-pan recipe, and tasting a similar dish in a restaurant in Houston, Texas. This recipe only has a handful of ingredients, and itâ€™s super simple to make. It works well for hosting a brunch party on the weekend, meal prepping for the week ahead, and adding variety to your keto meal prep.",
