      "description": "A buttery, also known as a roll, rowie, rollie, Aberdeen roll is a savoury Scottish bread roll. They are noted for flaky texture and buttery taste, similar to a flattened, round croissant, with a very salty taste. They are often toasted with jam or butter, or just with tea, although the high fat content (partly lard) makes them extremely hot when toasted.",
