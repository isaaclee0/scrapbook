      "description": "God..so true it is a deep personal relationship with God..we must talk to him daily, seek his will for us in what we are lacking daily, and let go have FAITH and give it to him..and rejoice and Praise him in the fact that he is our Father and always with us all we need to do is seek him he is there waiting. It is a beautiful peaceful feeling to have God with you at all times. Thank you my Heavenly Father ‚ù§",
