      "description": "On January 6th,  in Belgium and France, we celebrate Epiphany by eating the \"gateau des rois\". In general, the cake is a \"galette\" with almond cream inside (frangipane).  Do not forget to hide a \"trinket\" inside the dough before baking it. Usually it is a porcelain figure, but a dried bean will equally do the work. The person who picks the part of the cake with the trinket inside will be king or queen for a day (and wear the crown).",
