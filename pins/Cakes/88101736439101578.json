      "description": "Super-Moist Old Fashioned Chocolate Mayo Cake | The cake was superb in its appearance but that pales in comparison to the flavor. Moist; the antithesis of a grocery-store-dried-out-stale cake. Skip picking up a sheet cake and make your own I say; and make a mayo cake! It is decadent like a wedding cake. Made with love.",
