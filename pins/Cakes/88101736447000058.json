      "description": "If you love ginger, then this is the cake for you! This Ginger Sponge is extremely light and airy in texture, even the next day. The sponge itself has a mild ginger flavour and the hint of chocolate from the cocoa powder compliments this cake wonderfully. The filling is a combination of ginger marmalade and silky smooth vanilla mock cream. This cake would be perfect for High Tea or any other special occasion.",
