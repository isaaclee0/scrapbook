      "description": "Tarte Trop√©zienne looks simply divine. This special cream cake was invented by a local baker in--where else?--St. Tropez during the filming of the Roger Vadim cult classic \"And God Created Woman\" in 1956. The film's cast and crew became so enamored of the confection that the baker patented the name and his recipe, and the rest is history. Now every bakery in the city has a version.
