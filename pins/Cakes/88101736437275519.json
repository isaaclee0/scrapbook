Blum's was one of the best bakery/coffee shops in San Francisco and a favorite place to stop after a shopping trip downtown (or one of the other area locations) for lunch or a snack. Unfortunately, Blum's closed in the 1970s, but this cake was my grandma's favorite. Here you can find a recipe for the real deal!",
