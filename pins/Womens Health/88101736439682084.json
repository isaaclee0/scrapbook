      "description": "There are three major types of uterine fibroids. Intramural fibroids grow within the muscular uterine wall. Submucosal fibroids bulge into the uterine cavity. Subserosal fibroids project to the outside of the uterus. Some subserosal or submucosal fibroids are pedunculated â€” they hang from a stalk inside or outside the uterus.",
