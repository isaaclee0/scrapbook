      "description": "#Levator ani #syndrome is a long-term #medical condition characterized by #irregular episodes of rectal and #anal pain. #Levator ani is a broad muscle formed from three muscles, i.e. #pubococcygeus, #puborectalis, and #iliococcygeus. Spasm of these muscles results in constant dull pain in the pelvis. It is a nonrelaxing dysfunction of the #pelvic floor. #Muscles of the pelvic floor become too tight. Women suffer more commonly from this syndrome as compared to men.",
