      "description": "Carne con Chile Colorado from Rick Bayless. super wonderful! next time, i would use a chile or two less. new mexico chiles are the way to go. also added a substantial amount of cumin and more oregano than recipe asked for. i let it cook for about 90 minutes and it was perfect! served with traditional taco toppings, but would be great as a torta too",
