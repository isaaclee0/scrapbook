      "description": "I had a lovely time making this wedding invitation for Morgan & Ian who are getting married in August! Morgan is sewing her own dress, so it was fun being able to work from the actual pattern she’ll be using, and collage with a printout of the real fabric! Feel free to be in touch if you’d like to know more about getting custom wedding invitations, baby announcements etc. created. Watercolor, collage, colored pencil. Phoebe Wahl 2015.",
