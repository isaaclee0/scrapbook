      "description": "by Charles Spencelayh Two Minutes Silence is a poignant reflection of wartime and even in 2014 100 years after the outbreak of WWI, the pathos of this painting resonates. The clock marks the eleventh hour as the elderly gentleman prays for the son lost in the war, whose portrait hangs above the clock and a jar of garden flowers that have been arranged in his memory. Spencelayh was staunchly patriotic and deeply affected by the war, painting several pictures which take their theme from this war",
