      "description": "Chicken in the grass. Painting by David C. Lyons. David C. Lyons was born in Lancashire in the North West of England and has lived there all his life. He paints mainly aspects of the area which at first may seem nostalgic but references have been gathered from current locations so everything is as it really is. He was made a Fellow of the British Society of Painters in 2001 and his work has been sold throughout the world.",
