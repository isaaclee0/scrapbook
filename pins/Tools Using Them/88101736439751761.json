      "description": "Finger Wrench -- You know immediately that you could have used this tool hundreds of times in the past. Every time you have to hold a small nut or bolt (it holds either) in an awkward spot, this wrench works marvellously. Finger pressure holds the nut or bolt in the wrench, while the raised, tapered slot prevents it from turning. Made from high-impact ABS, the sleeve adjusts to fit any size of finger. Holds all nuts up to 1/2\" Price: $3.95",
