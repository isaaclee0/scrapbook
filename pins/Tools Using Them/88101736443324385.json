      "description": "A stripped screw can turn a 10-minute fix into a two-hour nightmare. One of the best investments a DIYer can make is a screw extraction kit.

One side of the extractor bit reams a hole into the screw, and the other side has reverse threads that dig into the screw as you turn it out.",
