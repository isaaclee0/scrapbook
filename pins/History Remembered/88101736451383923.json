      "description": "This young boy worked in the mines because children were cheap labor.  He spent ten hours a day in that get up with only the light from that tallow wick lamp, cleaning  and playing the part of a canary (kids were easier to replace than a  good miner). Probably Finnish/Swedish and indentured to the company to pay his fathers debts to the company store.  The unions fought hard to get these children out of the coal mines.  This little guy worked (and likely died) in Utah or Colorado mines...:(",
