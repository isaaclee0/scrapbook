      "description": "if you do this to others, please STOP IT!  One of my biggest pet peeves occurs when people point instead of extending their hand to help someone who needs their help.  Most of the people who are hurting aren't stupid.  Many know exactly why they are suffering and many even know what they \"need\" to do, but for a multitude of reasons they simply can't and need your help.... be kind, help",
