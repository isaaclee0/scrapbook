      "description": "Stay out of other people’s drama and don’t needlessly create your own.  Don’t spew hostile words at someone who spews them at you.  Keep your composure and replace the stink of confrontation with the fragrance of resolution.  The louder the opposition wants to yell, and the more drama they want to stir, the calmer and more confidently you need to think and speak.  Don’t let them get to you. - via: http://www.marcandangel.com/2013/08/01/7-negative-people-you-need-to-ignore/",
