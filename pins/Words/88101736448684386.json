      "description": "The excuse for killing a baby usually falls under saving them from a bad life. First of all, NOBODY knows 100% what someone’s life will be like, why would we kill them based on that? 49+ years of abortion and there’s still kids in foster homes, still kids who are being abused and go hungry. That doesn’t mean their life is worthless and it can’t or won’t get better. Killing the baby guarantees they will never have a better life and wounds the mother in the process. #prolife #plannedparenthood #",
