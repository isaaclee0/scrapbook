      "description": "Question: \"How should a Christian deal with feelings of guilt regarding past sins, whether pre- or post-salvation?\"  Answer: Everyone has sinned, and one of the results of sin is guilt. We can be thankful for guilty feelings because they drive us to seek forgiveness. The moment a person turns from sin to Jesus Christ in faith, his sin is forgiven. Repentance is part of the faith that leads to salvation ~,Matthew 3:2; 4:17; Acts 3:19,1 Corinthians 6:9-11,1 John 2:1,Revelation 12:10",
