      "description": "The Delicious Veneto | Cooking LightCranberry beans: The borlotti (cranberry beans) of Lamon are rich and creamy, and used in the classic pasta e fagioli, as well as on their own in side dishes. From late summer to December they are available fresh, but canned and dried beans are available year-round.  Asiago: Named for the town at the foot of the Dolomites, this cheese is available both young, when it is tender and almost creamy, and as a firm aged cheese with a pronounced flavor.  Dried porcini mushrooms: These mushrooms offer comforting earthy flavor and meaty textures.  Taleggio: From Treviso, the eastern part of Veneto, this creamy, rich Brie-like cheese is often used in pastas and risottos.  Pumpkin: A pumpkin known by the name zucca barucca is used in risottos and as a filling for ravioli. Its flavor is quite different from that of American pumpkin, so substitute butternut squash, which more closely resembles this variety.  Celery root: The celery of Verona is not actually the head of celery but celery root, which is used raw in salads, cooked in soups, and as a filling for ravioli.  Peas: In May and June, the sweet fresh peas of Peseggia, north of Venice, are in season, and the locals make risi e bisi (rice and peas) and freeze whatever is left to use in other dishes they prepare throughout the year.  Monte Veronese: This rich, full-flavored cowâ€™s milk cheese is prized as a table cheese and used in pasta and risotto dishes.",
