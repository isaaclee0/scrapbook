      "gridTitle": "Sicilian Stuffed Squid Recipe",
      "description": "This is a typical Italian coastal dish with the breadcrumbs adding substance and soaking up the briny squid juices. The stuffing is packed with intense, punchy flavours that sing of the Mediterranean and more exotic climes that whisk you off on holiday. Use fresh squid if you can find it for this recipe as the texture is better, although a good quality frozen squid will do nicely.",
