      "description": "Sweet Onion & Bread Soup. Made this tonight and loved it! Changes:    used brown onions,  roughly chopped the onions,    used half and half,    used more butter,  used 5-6 cloves of garlic,  only used 3/4 tsp dried thyme,  added an extra 8oz can of chicken broth,  added an extra 1/4 cup half and half,  added 3/4 tsp table salt.  The 'broth' was so savory and delicious, and while the bread did become soggy, I loved the flavor and texture it provided to the soup.",
