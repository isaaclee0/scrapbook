      "description": "I'd never made spoon bread until recently, and now I'm a total fan. This Jalepeno Cheddar Spoon Bread recipe from Spoon Fork Bacon is my new favorite. It is amazing at the bottom of a bowl of chili or as a side dish for just about any family supper. Somewhere in texture between mashed potatoes and cornbread, this is a tasty treat in a category all its own.",
