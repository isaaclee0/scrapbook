      "description": "This Baked Creamed Corn Casserole with Bacon is a little different to the standard corn casserole; this version doesn't have any flour in it, making it naturally gluten free, plus it uses creamed corn to make a delicious creamy sauce without the need for cream or butter. So really this is a healthy option, well if you discount the crispy bacon that is generous stirred through and sprinkled on top. Such an easy make ahead side dish perfect for Thanksgiving. #thanksgivingsidedish #creamedcorn",
