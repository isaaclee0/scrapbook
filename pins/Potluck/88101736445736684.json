      "description": "Fish soup. Our family is crazy about this soup. My daughter especially! She loves Sole and Swai fillet and either one is perfect to make this soup. Can't be easier to make but so delicious. It's red in color because of the tomatoes. It is lightly sour from the limes, a little hint of spiciness from the chili (or you can make it as spicy as you want). Absolutely love this dish!",
