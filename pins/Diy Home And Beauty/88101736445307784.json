      "description": "Here is a tip if you are running baseboard and come across a toilet supply that is too low. Typically I see people notch the baseboard (bottom) and then fill around the pipe cover plate with caulking. I don't think I need to remind you how hacked that looks. Extend your baseboard up with a few 45* cuts, so the cover plate can land on the flat. Also, note the more attractive solid plumbing line versus braided plumbing.",
