      "description": "Here is a tip if you are running baseboard and come across a toilet supply that is too low.  Typically I see people notch the baseboard (bottom) and then fill around the pipe cover plate with caulking. I don't think I need to remind you how hacked that looks.  Extend your baseboard up with a few 45 cuts so the cover plate can land on the flat.  Yes it takes a few extra minutes and its behind a toilet but would you rather spend a few minutes now or look at an eyesore forever?  #tip #baseboard #to",
