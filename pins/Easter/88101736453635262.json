Frost with chocolate frosting & cover to make a rounded mound leaving one side open for your cave entrance. Toss some coconut in green food dye to make your grass & spread around. Take some crumbled graham crackers for your loose dirt. Use a large York Peppermint Patty for your stone, but leave it covering cave until Easter morning.",
