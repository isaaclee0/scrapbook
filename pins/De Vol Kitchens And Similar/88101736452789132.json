It is freestanding in style, very reminscient of how our kitchens used to look - strong pieces of individual furniture that can be moved from home to home, our Classic English kitchen furniture will just get better and better over time.  #deVOLKitchens #KitchenIdeas #PantryDesign #FreestandingKitchen",
