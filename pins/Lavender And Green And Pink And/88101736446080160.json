      "description": "Cat Mint.....Walker's Low (nepeta-faassenni).  It was named by the Perennial Plant Assoc. as the \"Plant of the Year\" in 2007.  Very hearty....loves sun.  Great smell of mint is a treat.  No problems, at least in my yard, (Northern MI) with deer.  I planted 6 plants 4 years ago and they are beautiful.  Everyone in my neighborhood thinks it's lavender so I get to introduce them to Cat Mint!  I've also had great luck with starting new plants using a hormone powder and garden soil.",
