      "description": "Benjamin Moore Camelot is the most ‘purple’ of the bunch mentioned here.  Camelot has a strong purple tone, without becoming ‘royal’.  Also check out, Benjamin Moore Vintage Wine or Amazon Soil.  Vintage Wine is very rich, dark and subtle, without looking ‘grape-ish’.  Amazon Soil has a slightly more pink undertone compared to the options above",
