Change out your builder grade brass shower trim using Rustoleum's Oil Rubbed spray paint ... what would cost you $800 to replace, will only cost you $5 to paint. Holds up well with the water because it is indoor/outdoor paint..... (Pinner says: I also did this with my light fixtures when we moved into our house)",
