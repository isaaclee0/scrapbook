      "description": "We wanted to paint all 20 doors in the house, but where do you put them while they're wet? By screwing short 2x4 blocks to the ends, we were able to paint both sides of each door and then stack them neatly while they dried. Just make sure to keep the same spacing between every pair of blocks. â€” Charles Sapp, St. Charles, Mo. | Photo: Ian Spanier | thisoldhouse.com",
