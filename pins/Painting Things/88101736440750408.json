It was first painted with GF Somerset Gold Milk Paint then a layer of Corinth Blue Milk Paint.  It was distressed to show the gold paint underneath.  The hutch top was also stained with our Java Gel Stain.  Learn more about distressing here, http://youtu.be/DQilIHtFxpY  #generalfinishes #gfmilkpaint #javagel #distressed",
