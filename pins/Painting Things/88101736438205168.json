      "description": "Amish Whitewash for chicken coop interior: 1 gallon water; 2 pounds salt; 7 pounds hydrated lime. **The lime is fine so wear a respirator while mixing and gloves because it is caustic.** Use warm water, dissolve salt. Stir in lime until dissolved. Apply with sprayer or paint brush. Whitewash is not waterproof so use for indoors only. It is used to kill bacteria and vermin, to deodorize, and to brighten interiors.",
