      "description": "We painted our mudroom/kitchen floors and our laundry room floors not long after we moved in almost a year ago and they've held up surprisingly well! Occasionally we'll get a scratch or a ding that's bad enough to warrant pulling out the oil-based paint for a touch up, but that's only happened a couple of times. I used Glidden Porch and Floor paint in gloss for the kitchen and mudroom and I like that one best. I usually just get it color matched.",
