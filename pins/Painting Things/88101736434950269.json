      "description": "From the comments: This cabinet looks great. The version of homemade chalk paint I used does not have any hot water in it, and it sticks to everything, no matter what kind of paint I started with. I mix 1 cup latex paint to 1/4 cup of P/P. Two coats will cover and stick to anything. I have used leftover paint in satin, eggshell, glossy, semi-gloss and matte, and it all seems to work. The only prep work I did was a quick wash dow with some Krud Kutter and rinse, and dry off.Hope this helps.Ellen",
