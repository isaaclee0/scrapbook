      "description": "To make your own white wax I used one tablespoon of paint for 3 tablespoons of wax. Any acrylic paint will work. I then took a teaspoon and really mixed the wax and paint together well. Using a wax brush, I applied the wax. I then wiped the wax, let it dry, reapplied a second coat and then buffed for a gentle sheen. If your furniture is not smooth to touch after applying wax, you need another coat. It should* no longer feel chalky. I will usually apply at least two thin coats of wax.",
