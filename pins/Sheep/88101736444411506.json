      "description": "When sheep herders in the hills of Lombardy, Italy need to move their flocks toward better grazing land, the wee lambs get a little help keeping up with their woolly family. Helpful donkeys are fitted with sets of special lamb-sized pouches. Itâ€™s ridiculously cute and cozy mass transit in the form of live taxis who are content to graze right along side the sheep.",
