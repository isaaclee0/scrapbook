I have always had trouble with the tortillas sticking and tearing apart, and I am so grateful for the solution found in the reviews: add more masa harina. Also, used the cut up freezer bag tip. I don't have a tortilla press (I will get one now), so I pressed down on the ball of dough with a frying pan, and that worked far better than a rolling pin or my hands.\"",
