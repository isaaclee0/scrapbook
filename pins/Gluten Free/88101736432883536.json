      "description": "Paleo Moist Chocolate Zucchini Bread (nut free)  I made this with Almond Butter, and it came out SOOO delicious!  Have already made this again (a double batch even).  If you don't want to use half a roll of paper towels to soak up the water in the zuchinni, I had success using some paper towels, and adding in about a Tablespoon of ground flax.  Good use of all the zucchini I get from my MIL!",
