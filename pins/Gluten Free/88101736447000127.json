      "description": "Gluten-Free Fudge Cake. I have been making this cake recipe, using traditional all-purpose flour, for 30 years! And, the original recipe uses boiling water instead of coffee. Either version is chocolate cake perfection!!! One more thing...if you are not in the mood to make a frosting, fresh, whipped cream can be used. Don't ice the cake with the whipped cream, just put it on each individual serving.",
