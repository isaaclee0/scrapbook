      "description": "California's first fashion designer, Levi Strauss, died in 1902. Strauss came to California to open a dry goods business during the Gold Rush and was successful, but his fame came after he created a durable pair of \"waist trousers\" made of material originally used for tents. In 1873, Strauss patented the process of putting rivets in his pants, which became the \"jeans\" of choice for miners.",
