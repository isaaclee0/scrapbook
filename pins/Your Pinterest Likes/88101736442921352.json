      "description": "“There's this youth culture […] it really discards people once they reach a certain age. I actually think that people are so powerful and interesting — women, especially — when they reach my age. We've got so much to say, but popular culture is so reductive that we just talk about whether we've got wrinkles, or whether we've put on weight or lost weight, or whether we’ve changed our hairstyle. I just find that so shallow.\" — Annie Lennox, turning 60",
