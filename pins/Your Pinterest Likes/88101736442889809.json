      "description": "\"We’ve been living in Médoc, France, for nearly 18 months now.   And it’s taken me some time to adapt.  Getting out of a city is like a detox program.   No one is stressed out here. Stores, banks, post offices – they have long daily lunch breaks.  No one is in a rush.  People you meet talk about the mushrooms they found in the forest, or where the geese are flying to (it’s an indication of how soon summer will come).  It’s nice.\"",
