      "description": "Major Karl Plagge (1897-1957) was a German Army officer who used his position to employ and protect some 1,240 Jews at the HKP562 slave labor camp in order to give them a better chance to survive. The 250 to 300 surviving Jews from the camp constituted the largest single group of survivors of the genocide in Vilnius, Lithuania. Like Oskar Schindler, Plagge blamed himself for not having done enough. In 2005, Yad Vashem posthumously honored him with as one of the “Righteous Among the Nations”.",
