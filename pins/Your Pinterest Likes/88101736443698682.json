      "description": "Africaâ€™s Great Green Wall Against Climate Change Begins - Senegal's capitol city Dakar sticks out into the Atlantic Ocean on a peninsula. It's at least a thousand miles to the Sahara desert yet the air today is so thick with sand that the tops of buildings disappear in a sandy haze. It's the worst sand storm in a year and people here are worried that climate change will cause these events to be more common. Seasons are shifting across the region.",
