      "description": "Humans were not around 65 million years ago, never mind people who could work metal. So how does science explain metallic tubes dug out of 65-million-year-old Cretaceous chalk in France? In 1885 a block of coal was broken open to find a metal cube obviously worked by intelligent hands. In 1912 employees at an electric plant broke apart a large chunk of coal out of which fell an iron pot! A nail was found embedded in a sandstone block from the Mesozoic Era. And there are many more such anomalies.",
