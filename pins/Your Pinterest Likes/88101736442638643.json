      "description": "I guess a part of me felt like if I am sad about letting go, then maybe I’m not at that place of acceptance that I thought I was.  But I was wrong.  It is sad.  I must grieve.  I loved, gave my all, and almost died doing it.  Letting this go is incredibly sad, but on a much different level.  I started to realize that it was okay to be sad, and later that night, as I threw these things into the flames, I also knew that it was okay to let go.",
