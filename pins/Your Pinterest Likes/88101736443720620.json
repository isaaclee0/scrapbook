      "description": "Henry \"Black Death\" Johnson. By the time reinforcements arrived, Johnson had passed out from his wounds. By daylight, the carnage was evident: Johnson had killed four Germans and wounded an estimated 10 to 20 more in a savage hand to hand combat while suffering 21 wounds himself in the fight. Henry Johnson had prevented the Germans from breaking through the French line. He was the first American private to receive the Croix du Guerre, France’s highest military honor for extraordinary valor.",
