      "description": "Then there was the day that my daughter told me she was moving to the Czech Republic to be a missionary, and honestly the first thought in my mind was: She’s going to meet someone, fall in love, get married, and live there forever! I didn’t like the idea of losing my daughter forever. Or basically I didn’t have faith that my prayers had been working. Thankfully, God showed me that all my prayers HAD been answered, and I wasn’t losing a daughter but gaining a son.",
