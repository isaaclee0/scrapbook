      "description": "The late Dowager Duchess of Devonshire was buried in a wicker coffin and was buried among the Cavendish graves in the Edensor village cemetery. She was an elegant, old-school woman throughout her life, a very real and gracious lady who loved her rare breeds of chickens, Elvis Presley and purchased her clothing from agricultural fairs. Unique and part of a vanishing way of life that will never return.",
