With a half life of 2000 years, this means they loose virtually no power for several hundred years and still have half their power at the end of 2000 years. The magnets are approximately 1 inch x 1 inch x 4 inches long with a pull power of 255 lbs each. The combined power of the 16 magnets is 4080 pounds of pull. This simple new technology will soon energize cars, homes,power plants, just about everything.",
