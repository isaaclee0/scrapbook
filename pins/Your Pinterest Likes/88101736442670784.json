      "description": "Hans Scholl of The White Rose, a small group of students and one professor at the University of Munich who defied and spoke out against Nazi horrors. In less than a year in 1943 Hans, his sister Sophie and Christoph Probst were caught, “tried” and beheaded. They saw crimes against humanity and resisted, knowing that this would cost them their lives. At a time when conformity turned an entire nation into a murderous mob, they remained individualists, becoming heroes of all mankind.",
