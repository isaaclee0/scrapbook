      "description": "ATTENTION EVERYONE IN THE UNIVERSE...  clotted cream is better than sliced bread.  And I've got the easiest recipe via Alton Brown:    pasteurized (not ultra-pasteurized) cream    Line a wire strainer with a coffee filter and pour in cream to within 1\" of top of filter.  Place over bowl and place bowl in the fridge.  Every few hours or so, carefully scrape the filter with a rubber spatula and return to the fridge.  Repeat until it reaches the consistency of soft cream cheese.    YOU ARE WELCOME.",
