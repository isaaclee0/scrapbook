      "description": "Yellowstone Wolf 495M   495M was a remarkable wolf. At the time of his capture for collaring, he was the largest wolf ever recorded in Yellowstone, weighing in at 143 lbs. The researchers joked that they had darted a bear instead of a wolf because of his immense size. As the alpha male of Mollie’s Pack, 495M also displayed immense boldness. The hardy pack inhabited Pelican Valley in the park’s interior and regularly hunted bison instead of elk—no easy feat even for a wolf. And 495M at age 9—a noteworthy age for a wolf as most die at 4 or 5—still took bison down this year.",
