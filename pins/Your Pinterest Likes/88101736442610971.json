      "description": "Mushroom packaging is an alternative made entirely out mycelium, a network of fungal threads that’s “grown” around a filling of agricultural byproducts. The process takes about a week and takes place in the dark with no requirement for chemicals or even water. Strong and insulating, Mushroom Packaging can be formed into almost any shape. Mycelium can also be used for surfboards, car bumpers and even clothing – and once put in the ground it’s fully biodegradable.",
