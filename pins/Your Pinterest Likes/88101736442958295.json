      "description": "Kindle Touch- I am a bookaholic with a large personal library (>3,000 print books). Never thought I would get an e-reader but finally relented because of the CFS. It's much lighter and less tiring for me to hold and I can shop for books from home. I adore 'real' books and bookstores...my idea of heaven is coffee and hours browsing a good bookstore but I haven't been up to that for a while now. I still love the look and feel of a print book but I'm reading much more again with my Kindle.",
