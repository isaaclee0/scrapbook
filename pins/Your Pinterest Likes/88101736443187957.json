      "description": "Carolyn Jessop was 18 years old when she was forced to marry Merrill Jessop, a man nearly 40 years her senior. She lived a life of horrific domestic violence at the hands of her husband and her \"sister wives\" for 17 years before escaping with her 8 children. She was one of the first women to escape from the FLDS cult to win full custody of her children and was instrumental in putting Warren Jeffs away for life with her testimony in a Senate hearing. Her book blows open the shocking FLDS world.",
