      "description": "Iâ€™m Young, African American, Female and ... Republican: My mother gave birth to me when she was 16, and we received government assistance during the first few years of my life. When I was growing up, she taught me the importance of making a budget and living by it. In our home I learned the importance of having a plan and delaying gratification for the things I wanted or thought I deserved. Although she had me at a young age, my mother chose life. For that I am forever grateful to her.\"",
