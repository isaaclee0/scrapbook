      "description": "In brief, if individuals exposed to a stressful event play computer games immediately after the event, painful memories of trauma may be removed. In other words, playing Tetris could reduce PTSD according to preliminary research. An investigation of computer games as trauma intervention was inspired by previous studies that demonstrated that video games increase brain activity and actually create observable structural changes in the brain.",
