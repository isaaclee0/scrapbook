      "description": "Navy SEAL Chris Heben was shot in the stomach in a parking lot at 5 PM yesterday by \"3 gangbangers\" according to his Facebook. He put a finger in the bullet hole and chased them to get a vehicle description, then drove himself to the hospital. I know this will not receive any attention from the media and I only heard it because I live in the area so I just wanted to share it with you all. Whether at home or deployed, so many of them react in incredible ways to situations that most people can.",
