I hope that my Master will lay hold of some of them and say, \"You are mine, and you shall be mine. I claim you for myself.\" My hope arises from the freeness of grace, and not from the freedom of the will.-  Charles Spurgeon",
      "description": "Charles Haddon (CH) Spurgeon (19 June 1834 â€“ 31 January 1892) was a British Particular Baptist preacher. Spurgeon remains highly influential among Christians of various denominations, among whom he is known as the \"Prince of Preachers\". He was a strong figure in the Reformed Baptist tradition. Spurgeon produced powerful sermons of penetrating thought and precise exposition. Many Christians have discovered Spurgeon's messages to be among the best in Christian literature.",
