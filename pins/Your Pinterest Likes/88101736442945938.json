Upon entering the Magic Kingdom, one of the security guards said to the girl “Excuse me Princess, can I have your autograph.” I could see that the book was filled with children’s scribbles as the guard asked the same question of many little Princesses. The little girl could not get over the fact that the guard thought she was a real princess.”",
