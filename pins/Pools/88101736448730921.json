      "description": "The first thing you need to remember when you buy an Intex pool is that it must be cared for just like any other pool.  Your new pool will need a proper pump and filter depending on its size and you will need to carefully manage the pH levels and chlorine in the pool to be sure your water quality is always top notch.  If any of these chemical levels are off, algae can grow in your pool turning it green or your water could simply appear cloudy because the chemicals are not properly balanced.",
