      "description": "Paleo Low Calorie Crunchy Cauliflower - We are eating a vegetarian Paleo diet, and I was trying to think of an alternative to using flour for my Crunchy Cauliflower treats (a must for a healthy, low calorie super bowl party dish).  I tried this delicious substitute and was delighted with the result. Roasted nuts. Really tasty and crunchy and very easy to make. #lowcalorie #paleo",
