      "description": "Seafood paella!  I made this with the leftover riced cauliflower I had from the cauliflower pizza crust.  I modified it to make it pescetarian by using only seafood stock and omitting the meat.  I also cheated and used a frozen seafood mix and used cilantro instead of parsley because it was what I had in my fridge.  It still came out delicious and was super easy!",
