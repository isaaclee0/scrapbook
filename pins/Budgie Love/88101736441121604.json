      "description": "DIY Parrot Play & Forage Tree Great for stimulating exercise, fun, and to fulfill their natural foraging instinct. I used a large Vine Maple branch, (check for bird safe wood) trimmed to size, cleaned w/bleach solution, mounted in a Christmas tree stand that is set in a tub, added fleece accents & wreath swing, toys and foraging spots. (Later added small criss-cross branches, tied w/ jute. My conure had fun removing the leaves. Cleaned these w/ a vinegar solution.) My conure LOVEs it.",
