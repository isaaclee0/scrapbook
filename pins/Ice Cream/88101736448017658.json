You can omit the chocolate and add in berries, mango, banana, avocado, figs or stone fruit. Dress them up with your favourite add in ingredients, or keep it simple and enjoy them as they are. You can also dip or drizzle melted chocolate on top, sprinkle shredded coconut, orange zest, dried fruits, berries, hemp seeds, chopped toasted nuts or seeds, edible flowers and more!",
