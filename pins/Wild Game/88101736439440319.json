      "description": "Lapin au vin is a rustic stew based upon the French classic, coq au vin. The vegetables and rabbit are slowly braised in a rich broth of chicken stock and white wine. The real secret behind this recipe and many other similar French recipes is the practice of stewing the meat in the wine. While the chicken version can be traced all the way back to Roman times, when France was joined with Gaul",
