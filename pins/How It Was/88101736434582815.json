Little Ann Heath is eager to try out all the facilities of her parents' new 4-room unit, after spending most of her life in a single furnished room. She pushes a footstool to the sink in order to help clean up the dishes. Mrs. Heath, a native of Winsted, some 25 miles away, is delighted with her new kitchen - the first she's ever had - and is trying out all the recipes she has collected in five years of married life. The Heaths pay thirty dollars monthly.\"",
