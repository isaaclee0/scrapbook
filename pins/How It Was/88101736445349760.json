      "description": "Max Factor:  Born Max Faktor in Lodz, Poland during the 1870s, Max Factor is often called the father of modern makeup. In 1914, Max Factor created a makeup specifically for movie-actors that, unlike theatrical makeup, would not crack or cake. In 1904, Max Factor and his family moved to the United States, where immigration officials at Ellis Island gave him the  name Max Factor.  He sold his rouges and creams at the 1904 World's Fair.",
