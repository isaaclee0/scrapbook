      "description": "\"Girl with bound feet 1870-1890. The feet would then regularly be unbound, washed and kneaded, with additional pain often caused by beating the sole of the foot to keep the bones broken. The feet were then rebound â€“ ever more tightly each time. Whenever the binding session was over, the girl was immediately forced to walk on her feet to crush them further. None of this was carried out with any anesthetic.\"",
