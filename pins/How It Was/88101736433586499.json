      "description": "A Marijuana Crop in Crittenden County, Kentucky In 1942    This is an old photograph of a legally grown marijuana crop in rural Crittenden County, Kentucky that was taken in 1942. During World War II, the U.S. Government paid farmers in rural Kentucky to raise marijuana for national defense purposes. The marijuana plants were used to make rope. This particular crop was raised merely for the seeds, which were given back to the U.S. Government. Legal marijuana growing ended at the end of World War",
