      "description": "Regular weekly cleaning is key to a gleaming wood floor. Add a quarter of a cup of white vinegar to a gallon of warm water and use the mixture and a well rung-out mop to clean the floors, taking care not to over-wet the wood. It's actually better to use a vinegar mixture than oil soap or other detergent cleaners, because over time the soap will leave a build-up on your wood.",
