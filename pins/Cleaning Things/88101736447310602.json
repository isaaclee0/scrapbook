      "description": "Hopefully this will save you $100. When my front load washer (Whirlpool) quit draining I called the repair man. As soon as he arrives he asks if the drain screen had been cleaned out. WHAT?!? No information about THAT on the internet! 5 minutes & $100 later he has my machine back together & walks out the door. The cover panel is removed with 2 small screws at the bottom of the washer. See the car key in my pic? That was missing for over a year! Check yours out and clean out that drain.",
