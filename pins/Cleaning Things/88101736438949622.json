      "description": "Mix a paste of baking soda and lemon juice. The consistency of the paste should be about that of pancake mix. Spread the paste all along the bottom of the toilet (where it meets the floor), the toilet seat, and any other area that gets a lot of overspray. Let it set for about 10-15 minutes. Then spray the dried paste with white vinegar. Let it fizzle. When done fizzing wipe up with a damp cloth. Don't forget about the walls and cupboards on either side of the toilet.",
