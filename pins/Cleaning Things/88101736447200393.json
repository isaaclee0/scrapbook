      "description": "Know how to remove white burn marks from wood furniture? Ok, I ironed on my dining table, the heat went right through the triple folded cloth, and left white iron marks burned into the wood! I freaked and had a panic attack! Today, I attempted this removal method and it worked: lay a tea towel over the burn, with your iron on Medium, hover over the area with steam on then iron over, constantly moving the iron. Don't let the iron sit still! I did this gently many times and, Hallelujah! Success!",
