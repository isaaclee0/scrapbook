      "description": "DIY Rain Gutter Watering System: Turn your gutter into a sprinkler! This was a simple project that re-purposed a clogged, underground drainage pipe into an above ground rain gutter watering system! we drilled a series of holes into the pipe for our rain gutter watering system. After the holes were drilled, the pipe is reattached to the gutter. To raise it up a bit and ensure that the water drains into the pipe, a granite paver was placed underneath of the elbow.",
