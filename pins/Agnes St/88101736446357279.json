      "description": "My favorite room in our home is the kitchen and it’s undergone the most drastic changes. The kitchen was originally a galley-style and was divided into three separate spaces – kitchen, dining room, and breakfast room. From day one, I knew I wanted to remove the dividing walls to make it one large space. I also removed a closet and opened the wall to the living room. I worked within a very tight budget and was able to complete the kitchen space for around $10,000. Details on Home Bunch Blog",
