      "description": "Sloping the soil away from the foundation will remedy a wet basement most of the time. The Family Handyman recommends firmly packing clay soil around the foundation, with at least a 4-in. slope over the first 4 ft. Place 6-mil black plastic over the soil and cover it with landscape rock. Install 4- to 6-ft. gutter extensions to your downspouts to direct water farther away from your foundation.",
