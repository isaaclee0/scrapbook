      "description": "One of the best things we added to our hidden pantry room were these roll-out wire baskets!! We use them for onions and potatoes and other such food items that don’t need to be stored in the fridge but also shouldn’t be closed away and it’s such an easy and functional grab-and-go station for when you’re cooking! (Swipe to see them closed). And our containers have been awesome! They’re easy to open/close, actually airtight, leakproof, and dishwasher safe and the type of marker I use for labeling",
