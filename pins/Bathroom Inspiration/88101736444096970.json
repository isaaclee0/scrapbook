      "description": "Showers tucked into dormers can feel cramped and cavelike, but adding a skylight can remedy the problem. This shower becomes a bright oasis, thanks to a generous skylight. Inside the shower, slate-blue glass tiles line the back wall and continue on the floor, giving the shower focal-point status. A textured stone tile was used on the sidewalls, as well as elsewhere in the bathroom, to unify the spaces.",
