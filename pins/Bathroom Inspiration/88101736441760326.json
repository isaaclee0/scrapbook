      "description": "Making of a tadelakt bathtub.  We created a base of cellular concrete blocks. We then roughly created a shape and cut and carved the final shape out of it. After that we plastered it with a strong cement based plaster on a netting. As a finish we used Moroccan tadelakt. A waterproof plaster based on limestone. By polishing the plaster on the right moment it becomes waterproof and soft as silk. Made by: www.esencio.nl, www.ecobasis.net and Ruud Buyze",
