At the far end, just out of sight are the strawberries and raspberries, both red and the even more delectable yellow. The basket is full of the first, just dug, potatoes....To take that basket down late in the day and pick most of dinner is such a profound joy!  Summer food!  Kiss the ground! Frances Mayes",
