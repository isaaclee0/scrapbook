      "description": "Hay Bale garden info: Fertilizing along with the initial soaking provides a better base and growing conditions and saves you having to be so worried about getting nutrients to your plants as they start growing. Some materials to use are: A 1\" layer of fresh chicken manure - double that if aged chicken manure. Other suitable manures such as turkey or rabbit â€“ 2\" layer. A covering layer of 2/3 bone meal to 1/3 blood meal. A very thick layer of milder stuff such as spent coffee grounds.",
