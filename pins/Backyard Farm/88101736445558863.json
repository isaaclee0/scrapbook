      "description": "This two-bin composting system can be built by one person in about five hours. The bin holds one ton of properly moistened yard waste. It's rodent proof and has removable front doors to reduce the work of turning the compost. You'll never have to buy organic matter for your garden again!    You can also adapt this design to a three-bin system by adding another middle partition and increasing the length of the system to three feet.",
