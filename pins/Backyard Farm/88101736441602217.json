The kitchen compost is an important addition to our soil, and we rotate our vegetables among other approaches. Our hens are free range and raised on organic feed. We also have two hives of honey bees for pollination. We serve mostly all organic food in our kitchen http://www.organicholidays.co.uk/at/531.htm",
