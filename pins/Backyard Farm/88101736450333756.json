      "description": "An unmistakable thread of sustainability runs through most facets of photographer Marnie Hawson's life. It informs the choices she makes in the charming cottage she shares with her husband Ryan at Riddells Creek, 45 kilometres north-west of Melbourne. It influences both her ethics and natural aesthetics, the homegrown food she puts on the table, and it even extends to her work.",
