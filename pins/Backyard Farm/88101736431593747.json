      "description": "Jay began practicing organic no-till farming 16 years ago as a way to eliminate weeds. In fact, it does greatly reduce weeds – because the repeated layering of compost and mulch covers the weed seeds, they are constantly blocked from sunlight which prevents them growing. The weeds that Jay does find are very easy to pull because his soil is very loose.",
