Writing all of this down meant that I was able to see the “minus” factors (limiting factors) and problems with the present system, so on the same page I was able to add ‘Design to mitigate the limiting factors’ as a way of problem solving them. I then arrived at some new ideas and how to proceed on with the new design.\"",
