      "description": "DIY Drip Irrigation System, Made from Plastic Bottles- The 'system' is super simple. All we have to do is grab some 2-liter plastic bottles, punch 2 holes into the sides and 2 into the bottom, and plant said bottles next to plants. Fill them with water and our plants will get that slow watering they prefer. For more information about the project, visit Fine Craft Guild.",
