      "description": "Sweet, Crunchy Winter Carrots -   Create this mini root cellar to preserve your root vegetables. To make a nifty, mini root cellar right in the garden, simply bury a bucket and cover it with a straw bale. Keeps them fresh, sweet and crisp as they would be in the ground, but you don't have to go digging for carrots in midwinter! I'm going to try this with potatoes too. Genius!",
