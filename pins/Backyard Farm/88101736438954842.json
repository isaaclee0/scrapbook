      "description": "Dandelion (Taraxacum) Found in heavy, clay, compacted acidic soil, but also grows in fertile well-drained soil. The dandelionâ€™s taproots bring up calcium, iron, and a host of other minerals from the deep soil. The decomposing roots of dandelions produce humus. Flowering dandelions provide early spring pollen that attracts ladybugs and other beneficial insects to the garden. Edible. Dandelion leaves are sometimes used in salads. They are rich in beta carotene, vitamin C and vitamin A.",
