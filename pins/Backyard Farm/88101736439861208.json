      "description": "May 2013. In my small 25x30ft space, I've managed to create garden that is low maintenance and very productive using permaculture design. Looking down on the garden you can't quite see the raised beds full of annual veg from here (at the bottom) but you can see the lay-out I've designed to maximise food growing space (lots of perennials for a forest garden style polyculture) and still provide some space for relaxing in the sun. We've also managed to squeeze in some chickens too!",
