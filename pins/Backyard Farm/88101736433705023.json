      "description": "White Sonora Wheat is one of the oldest surviving wheat varieties anywhere in North America. The earliest records document it was extensively planted in the mountains of Sonora, Mexico in the early 1700s, and was widely planted in California by the early 1800s. Until the early 1900s, it provided most West Coast residents with their flour. Its flour makes stretchable dough, and is credited with the development of large flour tortillas, burritos and chimichangas.",
