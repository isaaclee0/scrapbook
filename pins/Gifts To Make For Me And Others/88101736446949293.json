      "description": "When Pam made preserves for a living, she tried all kinds of curds, from orange to passion fruit, but none of them was ever quite as popular as the good old-fashioned lemon variety. She didn't think she could improve on it until recently, when she came across an old recipe for an appley lemon curd. She tried it out and now prefers it even to a classic straight lemon curd - it's like eating apples and custard: softly sweet, tangy and quite, quite delicious.",
