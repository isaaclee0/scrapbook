      "description": "Just in time for entertaining guests this holiday season...a DIY tray upcycled from a thrift store cutting board! A little TLC goes a long way with an old wood cutting board...and it's super easy (and cheap!) to repurpose it into a rustic, farmhouse-style tray that looks like salvaged barn wood! Perfect for setting out coasters, napkins, and bowls of snacks- AND it'll protect your furniture from water rings! #SadieSeasongoods",
