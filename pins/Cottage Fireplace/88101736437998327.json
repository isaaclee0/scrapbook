      "description": "Bullerjan hot air furnaces have been around for about 30 years now with a loyal following in North America and mainland Europe.  They were first devised by Canadian Lumberjacks in the snowy Rocky Mountains for heating the log cabin quickly.     They set about making a stove of curved tubes and burning the wood within the barrel shape they had created. The curved pipes enabled the hot air to rapidly convect into the room. They had developed what we now know as the Bullerjan wood burning stove.",
