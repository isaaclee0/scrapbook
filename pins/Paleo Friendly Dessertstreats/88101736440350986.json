      "description": "Grain free cinnamon rolls- these are phenomenal!! I made the dough exactly as directed. For the filling, I just smeared date paste over the rolled out dough and sprinkled it with Penzey's Tung Hing Cinnamon. I carefully rolled and cut the dough into 10 spirals, then baked at 350 for approx 17 mins. No topping needed at all. They are perfect and decadent warm from the oven and unadulterated : )",
