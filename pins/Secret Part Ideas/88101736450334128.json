I came up with an idea for her birthday which was to cut out 80 hearts and write a simple thing we loved or reason we loved her. Some are silly, some are specific, some are just because! I am putting them in an envelope and giving them to her to read over, hopefully she enjoys it, and gets a giggle out of a few!",
