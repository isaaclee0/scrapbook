      "description": "For easy holiday entertaining, why not just set up a dessert tier with finger sweets? Serve with nice paper napkins and let them grab as they please.  Set up in a relaxed seating area away from dining area.  Clean up will be easy & you can also sneak into dining area to start removing dishes from the meal. As an alternative, bring a tray around with the sweets on them, still using napkins instead of plates.",
