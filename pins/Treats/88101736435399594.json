In his cookbook De re culinaria, the renown Ancient Roman gourmet Apicius describes a kind of sweet made with honey, almonds and egg whites.  As a matter of fact, the Italian word for nougat, which is “torrone”, derives from the Latin verb “torrere” which means “to roast”, with reference to the roasted almonds used to prepare it.",
