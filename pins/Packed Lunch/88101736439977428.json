      "description": "Pleasant pink coloured rotis made of whole wheat flour reinforced with grated beetroot are drizzled with hot-and-sweet sauce and packed with a tasteful cauliflower and green peas stuffing. When rolled up tightly and sealed with a toothpick, the wrap is comfortable to handle, without any stuffing spilling out. The fact that it stays fresh in the tiffin box for five hours makes this super-duper Cauliflower and Green Peas Stuffed Wrap a real winner!",
