      "description": "This Mexican-inspired foldover – a kind of burrito, really – is deliciously savoury and satisfying. It’s particularly good with some avocado inside or alongside – or you could make a quick guacamole. There are various other optional extras, listed below, that you can stuff in with the beans to make the foldover even more tempting.",
