      "description": "Beatrix Potter had a  strong involvement in sheep breeding. Along with sheep came Beatrix Potter's deep attachment to collies. The dogs on the farm were working dogs, living outside and totaly dedicated to their work, but Beatrix always had one dog which was especially hers. Kep was the first of a long line of collies, as devoted to his mistress as she was to him.",
