Colour of teeth – how well the whiteness balances the white of the eyes. Embrasures – the small triangular spaces between the tips of teeth. Gum line and gum health. Shape, colour, fullness and symmetry of lips. Buccal corridor – the space between the buccal surfaces of the maxillary posterior teeth and the corners of the mouth",
