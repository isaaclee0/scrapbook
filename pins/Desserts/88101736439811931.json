      "description": "If you want to please a special person on a special occasion, this is the right dessert to pick! a firm cheesecake finished with a sweet blueberry topping, this is a truly satisfying experience. It is quite exotic and different from other cheesecakes that make use of biscuits as a baseâ€”as this cheesecake uses soft luscious vanilla sponge. Since blueberries are not readily available in india, you can use blueberry crush, without changing the total effect in any way.",
