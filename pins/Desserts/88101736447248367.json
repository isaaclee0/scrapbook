      "description": "'Whitepot Pudding'. One of the most wonderful baked puddings of the early modern period & a precusrsor of the bread and butter pudding, but even nicer. These bread or sometimes rice-based puddings were usually flavored with rosewater and lightly spiced with nutmeg. There are recipes for them in most of the cookery books published in the 17th and 19th centuries. The one reproduced here is from John Nott's Cooks and Confectioner's Dictionary of 1723.",
