There are several peas in the history of this type variety; over time further reductions in height and advances in earliness were achieved. At 8\" tall this is the best dwarf pea for container gardening. Plants are able to withstand hard frosts. Shell, 50-55 days. http://www.seedsavers.org/Details.aspx?itemNo=1177",
