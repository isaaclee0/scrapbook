      "description": "One month ago we posted a before and after picture of our new vegetable garden. We thought of making a little monthly series out of it. We did not expect a big change after just 4 more weeks but the result was impressive. It is unbelievable how quickly everything has grown during a couple of days. We have already been able to harvest a lot, even startet fermenting and pickling to process all the veggies.",
