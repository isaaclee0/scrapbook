      "description": "Hamburg parsley. Unlike other types of parsley, this variety is grown for its parsnip-like roots. With a delicious flavour, they have a taste recalling a combination of celery and parsnip with nutty overtones. They can be used raw, sliced or grated in salads or cooked, roasted, mashed or fried. The young leaves can be used to add flavour to soups or stews. Although ready in September, the roots are hardy and can be left in the ground until required.",
