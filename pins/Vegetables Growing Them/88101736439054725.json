      "description": "Testing Soil Quality by Growing Radishes. If your radishes matured and you harvested a healthy crop, your garden soil is good to go. If your radishes fail to produce a vegetable root but grew a lush, healthy top that means that the soil lacks phosphorous and potassium. Yellow, unhealthy-looking (chlorotic) leaves tell you that iron, sulfur, nitrogen and other trace minerals are lacking in your soil. You will have to amend for these deficiencies as needed.",
