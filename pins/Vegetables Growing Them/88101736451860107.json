In the additional notes section, be sure to include info on crop rotation. Write in pencil. Use four different folder colors, one for each season (green=spring, yellow=summer, red/orange=fall, blue=winter), especially if you want to aim for year-round gardening. Store folders in an appropriately sized container.",
