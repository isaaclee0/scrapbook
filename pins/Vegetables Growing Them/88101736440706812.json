      "description": "SPONGOLITE  is actually ancient, fossilised sea sponges. It is comprised of almost 99% silica,  Silica plays a very important role in strengthening cell structure in plants, making them less susceptible to pest and disease attack. Extremely porous with a natural ability to hold onto water,  it does not tend to break down quickly.  In horticulture, it is used in potting mixes and garden beds to help with water retention. Avoid breathing dust particles for health reasons.",
