      "description": "Cattails have many uses & can be harvested throughout the growing season for food. In early spring, the young shoots be peeled & eaten like asparagus. In mid-summer, the flowers or cattails can be roasted & eaten like corn on the cob. The roots can be peeled & boiled like a vegetable. Better yeild than the potato. The pollen is high protein and can be used like flour without milling. The plant is also useful for making woven baskets. Source: WVU Extension Service",
