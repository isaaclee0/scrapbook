      "description": "The two bruschette are black cabbage and cannellini beans, doused with new oil from our grove. That’s it in the bottle but it’s rich green really.  The dish in back holds baked fennel. Ivan likes to serve meat on big cross sections of chestnut logs. After the bruschette, Domenica served her homemade pappardelle with lepre (wild hare) sauce. While the pasta cooked, Annetta heated her preferred iron on the wood-fired stove.",
