      "description": "Tôm Thịt Rim (Caramelized Pork and Shrimp) - \"Tom thit rim\" is one of the most popular dishes among Vietnamese dishes. It's extremely tasty, for some reason the flavor of shrimp (with shell) blends wonderfully with the pork belly when simmered in the fish sauce caramel. Vietnamese kids grow up liking this, I grew up liking this dish so much. It's a fattening and not healthful if you eat this all the time. DISCLAIMER - I do not like pork-belly, shrimp tail & skin!",
