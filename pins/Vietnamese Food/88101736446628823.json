      "description": "NYT Cooking: The focus of this broth, a base for pho dishes with tofu and a variety of mixed vegetables, is the charred ginger and onion. Spice comes from a bag filled with star anise, peppercorns, cinnamon stick and cloves and more flavor flows from an abundance of sweet vegetables. Nonvegetarians can add fish sauce to this aromatic and beautiful vegan broth if they wish.",
