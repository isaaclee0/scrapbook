This mildly spicy broth with its signature lemon grass infusion balances beautifully with the he  rbs, mints, bean sprouts and freshly shredded banana flower. My version is simplified so that anyone can make it, however if you’re more adventurous you can also add the traditional ingredients such as cubes of congealed pork blood, pig’s knuckles…etc.",
