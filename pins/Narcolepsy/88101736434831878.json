Just as some have cataplexy and some do not, every narcoleptic's severity of the symptoms they have is different. This is why narcolepsy is a master of disguise and those who are lucky enough to be accurately diagnosed often still have a long road ahead of them towards finding the right medications for them at the right doses.",
