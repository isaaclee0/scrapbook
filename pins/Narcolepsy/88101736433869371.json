      "description": "A woman with narcolepsy who suffers up to six sleep attacks a day has had her life transformed by a very special dog.  Annick, 35, from Belgium, never knows when she will drop off. She slept up to 16 hours a day and needed careful supervision from her parents.  But she has been given a new lease of life thanks to the arrival of a little white dog called Idefix. The five-year-old mongrel is trained to wake her by nipping her ankles or ears at train and bus stops or when he hears an alarm.",
