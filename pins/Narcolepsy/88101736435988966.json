      "description": "UCLA researchers have for the first time measured the activity of a brain region known to be involved in learning, memory and Alzheimer's disease during sleep. They discovered that this region, called the entorhinal cortex, behaves as if it's remembering something, even during anesthesia–induced sleep — a finding that counters conventional theories about sleep-time memory consolidation.",
