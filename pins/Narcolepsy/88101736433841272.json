      "description": "In narcolepsy, the brain does not pass through the normal stages of dozing and deep sleep but goes directly into rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. As a result, nighttime sleep does not include much deep sleep, so the brain tries to \"catch up\" during the day. Narcolepsy is attributed to deficient production in the brain's lateral hypothalamus of the neuropeptide protein called hypocretin (image), which is the hormone known to regulate sleep patterns.",
