      "description": "A new study published by Cell Press on September 8 in the American Journal of Human Genetics uncovers a mutation that causes narcolepsy in a large family affected by the disorder. The research sheds new light on the genetics of inherited narcolepsy and provides intriguing insight into other complex neuropsychiatric disorders.  â€œThe cause of this rare form of inherited narcolepsy has been very difficult to study and is not well understood",
