      "description": "More than 3,000 Yazidi women and children have been captured by Islamic State militants and are reportedly being trafficked for sex. One young woman who escaped told BBC News she saw girls as young as nine being sold. The Yazidis are asking for support to bring back their girls and have drawn up lists of those they're searching for. \"They took all our girls. It's all we care about. The world must help us,\" said one woman whose two daughters are missing.",
