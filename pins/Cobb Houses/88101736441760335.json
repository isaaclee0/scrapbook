      "description": "Tadelakt, a nearly waterproof lime plaster, originates from Morocco. It can be found on both the interiors and exteriors of buildings there, including hammams (Moroccan bath houses).  The traditional finish starts out light gray and is mixed with natural colors to create a bright, striking surface.  The plaster is traditionally polished with a river stone to yield a smooth, glossy finish, which is then rubbed with soft soap to provide water resistance.",
