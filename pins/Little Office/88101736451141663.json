Silverware caddies, painted to match the hutch's exterior, organize pens, scissors, and a stapler and can be carried to the table when needed. A pull-out shelf made with drawer glide hardware ensures hassle-free access to the laptop and printer. Cords are kept out of sight by a concealed surge protector (situated behind the computer).",
