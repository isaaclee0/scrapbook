      "description": "In this video, we're going to focus on instant sciatica pain relief with Dr. Rowe's Seated Sciatica Slayer. It's a two part exercise that can be done in a chair that will help quickly take pressure off lumbar spinal discs (i.e. a herniated disc or bulging disc), the main cause of pinched nerves that leads to sciatica leg pain. It can be done at home, requires only a chair, and may give quick pain relief... even within 30 seconds! Let us know how it works for you!",
