      "description": "The psoas (s≈ç-≈èz) muscle is approximately 16 inches long. It begins at both sides of the 12th thoracic vertebrae of the back, and stretches all the way down to each of the legs, where it makes a final connection with the lesser trochanter. Also referred to as the \"tenderloin,\" the psoas muscle is very thick and strong, and it is also the largest muscle found in the body and often the reason for lower back pain.",
