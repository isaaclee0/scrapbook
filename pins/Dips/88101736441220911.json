My family enjoys Mexican food on so many times during the week, it's hands down some of our favorite food to enjoy as a family.</p>  <p>I put together two of our favorite things...homemade queso dip and bean dip.  Wait until they are combined and baked to perfection.  It's a match made in bean dip heaven.  Perfect for Cinco de Mayo or any party with hungry guests.  This one does not disappoint.</p>  <p>Hope you enjoy!</p> ...",
