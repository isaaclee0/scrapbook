      "description": "Pine Needle Tea - ½ cup of pine needles (or other needles from fir or spruce trees)  Crush the needles slightly  add to a pot of boiling water (3-4 cups). Simmer for 15-20 mins, or simply steep the needles in not yet boiling water.  You can add a spoon of honey or other liquid sweetener (maple syrup, raw honey), as well as herbs such as rosemary or green tea, to this wonderfully aromatic brew. Hopefully vitamin C is not destroyed by high temperatures but leaches into the water. ♥",
