      "description": "The monoterpene components of dill have been shown to activate an enzyme which helps attach the anti-oxidant molecule glutathione to oxidized molecules that would otherwise do damage in the body. The activity of dill's volatile oils qualify it as a food that is \"chemoprotective\"  & can help neutralize types of carcinogens, that are part of cigarette, bbq, & trash incinerator smoke. #dherbs #healthtips",
