      "description": "Go to the lumber yard & buy 1\" thick x 10\" wide premium white pine 8' boards at $0.85/linear foot. hand sand all the edges so they aren't sharp/look older. Then cut them in a staggered length & place down to assure u like the pattern. apply PL400 subfloor glue along the bottoms & lay them down butted up board to board (the sanded edges provided some small gaps between them for character.) he used a nail gun/compressor with finish nails for extra hold. Apply Watco Danish Dark Walnut Oil.",
