      "description": "Tip of the Day: diy Painted and stenciled floors are a thrifty décor solution for high-traffic areas. You can paint over concrete floors, any sort of wood floor you’d rather not refinish. There are great stencil design ideas online, or adapt your own from patterns in your wallpaper, drapes or upholstery fabrics. For simple geometric designs, with a chalk line and some painter’s tape, you can create the look of an area rug with a border, checkerboard marble, stripes, damask or brocade.",
