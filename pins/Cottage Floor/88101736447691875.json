      "description": "Tom and Alison had \"grungy greige dust-mite-infested allergy-inducing wall-to-wall carpet\" in their 90-year-old rental so they took a big risk and pulled it up (with landlord permission of course).  The beautiful wood was in great condition except for this one spot, so they found a beautiful and unique (not to mention genius) way to enjoy their new floors, rot-free.",
