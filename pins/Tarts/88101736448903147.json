      "description": "This cookie-like crust is perfect for custard or fresh fruit fillings that don't need further cooking, such as this combination of peaches and mascarpone cheese. I usually make this dough in a stand mixer. If using a hand mixer, you’ll need to mix the ingredients a little longer to get the results described. The extra mixing won’t hurt this very forgiving dough.",
