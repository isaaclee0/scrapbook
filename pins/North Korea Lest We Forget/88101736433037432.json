      "description": "Satellite images show gulags still operational in North Korea - Satellite images suggest that contrary to reports that Pyongyang had shut down its largest labour prison in June, Camp 22 is still serving as a penal gulag for thousands of inmates. As many as 50,000 inmates are held at the camp, producing furniture or labouring in coal mines or the fields. In total, some 100,000 people are believed to be held in North Korean labour camps.",
