      "description": "North Korean defector: 'I still cannot forgive myself' (27-10-14)  In 1994 I decided to leave North Korea for China. There were two reasons: food rations were decreasing and my private business had become the target security agent crackdown.  We had to get up dawn and work before breakfast. Every day, we survived on corn and chestnuts and bland salt soup. Some people died of starvation and some women stopped menstruating. The living dead were everywhere.",
