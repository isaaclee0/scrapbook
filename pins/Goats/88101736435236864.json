      "description": "The Nigerian Dwarf goat is a miniature dairy goat breed. Nigerian Dwarf goats are popular as hobby goats due to their easy maintenance and small stature. Nigerian Dwarfs give a surprising quantity of milk for their size. They are thus ideal milk goats for most families. Their milk has a higher butterfat content than milk from full-sized dairy goats, making Nigerian Dwarf goat milk excellent for cheese and soap making. Nigerian Dwarfs are gentle and easily trainable goats.",
