      "description": "This version is inspired by the original Laoganma's Spicy Chili Crisp, but taken up a notch. It's loaded with extra-large pieces of fried shallot and garlic chips, bonus aromatics for some subtle background noise, and peanuts for a nutty crunch. This recipe can easily be adapted to suit your taste.",
