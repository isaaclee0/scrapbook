      "description": "With refined coconut oil for richness and stability, plus the toasty, nutty flavor of malted milk powder, these easy brownies combine the convenience of a boxed mix with the satisfaction of a totally homemade dessert. A blend of dark chocolate and Dutch cocoa delivers a deep, complex flavor, while a tiny pinch of espresso powder adds a hint of bitterness to keep the sweetness of these chocolate brownies in check.",
