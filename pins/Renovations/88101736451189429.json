      "description": "they bought a very inexpensive (Whirlpool) fridge that had a flat door and hardware that could easily be removed. After taking off the handles, it was framed with trim that was screwed on. A flat thin veneer wood panel was glued inside the trimmed area, and they caulked and painted the door fronts to match the rest of the cabinetry in the room. The handles are boat hardware and Lori bought them from West Marine Store for $10 each. Genius!",
