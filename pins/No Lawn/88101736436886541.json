      "description": "Corsican Mint ~ Wonderful, mat forming groundcover that features tight green, aromatic foliage. Tiny lavender flowers in summer. Plant as a lawn substitution or between stones so that the gentle scent of mint is released when walked on. Excellent for front entryways and back patios. Will take moist areas as well as normal landscape scenarios and will reseed easily in the garden.",
