      "description": "An herbaceous, flowering lawn alternative and a longtime favorite in the northwest. This mix makes it possible to enjoy a bit of the countryside in your own outdoor living space.    Fleur de Lawn is very drought tolerant and stays green with little care. The nitrogen fixating clover naturally self-feeds the lawn and the low growing flowers give it beautiful blooming color.",
