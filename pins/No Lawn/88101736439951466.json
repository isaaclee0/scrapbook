      "description": "I want this stuff if the description is true. The very tiny Irish Moss seeds create a moss-like, emerald-green foliage that forms a compact 1 - 2 inch tall carpet. Sagina Subulata ground cover is excellent for planting between flagstones. Grown as a lawn substitute, it creates the effect of a moss-covered meadow. Irish Moss is very soft to walk on barefoot, and it has a slightly spongy feel to it.",
