      "description": "Grass Alternative: If your lawn area is not a high-use part of your yard, there are several varieties of clover that make an excellent alternative to a grass lawn. Clover requires no chemical fertilizers to grow, infrequent mowing and is inexpensive to plant. Your clover lawn will stay green even during the driest parts of summer, and the deep root system helps it grow with little to no water. Although it is not as durable as grass, you can sit and walk on your clover lawn without problems.",
