      "description": "Use Every Square Inch - When you plan a no-mow backyard, itâ€™s important to put every square inch of space to work. For example, this urban lot is paved with tightly fitted flagstone pieces interspersed with small streams of river rock to create a natural, easy-care environment. A deck made from composite materials anchors the opposite end of the yard. Sheared evergreens and trees complete the setting.",
