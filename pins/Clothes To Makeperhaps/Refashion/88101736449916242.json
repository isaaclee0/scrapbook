      "description": "Awesome outfit from an old sweater and a Henley shirt. A guide on how to lengthen your t-shirts. Change up a skirt to a fancy top. Who couldn’t use more yoga pants? Make some from a t-shirt. This refashion turned out really great! This skirt to a dress is really impressive. I love the way this one looks – so pretty! It can’t get any easier than this – an “8 Second” Transformation. I have shirts that would be perfect for this project. Pillowcase top tutorial.",
