      "description": "Sempervivum Plant - Calcareum A pretty alpine plant. Spreading mats of fleshy rosettes. Amongst the easiest of plants to grow, they will tolerate heat, drought and neglect and still manage to thrive!   Alpines are a range of plants that have their origins in alpine, mountainous climates. They can be grown in patio containers, an old sink, between paving stones, in dry-stone walls or in a rockery - so are perfect for small, modern gardens, patios or balconies.",
