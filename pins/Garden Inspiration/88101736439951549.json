      "description": "A Natural Way to REPAIR Brown Grass from Dog Urine. Pouring 2 tablespoons of baking soda dissolved in a gallon of water on a burn spot neutralizes the concentrated amounts of ammonia and nitrogen that’s in the dog urine and burns the grass. The grass comes back green and healthy and you don’t have to worry about the dogs walking through a yard full of lawn chemicals and possibly ingesting something toxic when they lick their paws.",
