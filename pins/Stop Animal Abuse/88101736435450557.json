The hand of an unknown monkey at a testing facility, grasping the side of the trash can after they discarded her for dead.  Many people believe Veganism is a diet. No, it is not. It is the belief that all animals  have the right to live out their full lives without being enslaved, encarcerated, exploited and killed without regard for what is right or fair.",
