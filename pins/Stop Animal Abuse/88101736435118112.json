      "description": "I BEG YOU!!! PLEASE SIGN!!!! UNBELIEVABLE !!! Right now in Moran Market, South Korea thousands of dogs are being tortured for the 60 day dog torture fest called Bok Days. South Korean children are attending and there are toy dogs for sale with sticks attached, so the kids can take them home and play \"torture\". Also sex aids are being sold at the festival. They believe if the dog is tortured they will receive the benefits and it will aid their sexual powers.",
