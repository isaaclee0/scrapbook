The green object is a piece of green chilly which has been stuffed in the eye to ensure the animal does not lie down due to the burning sensation in his or her eyes. During the entire journey of 3 to 4 days, the animals are forced to keep standing.They need to keep them standing so that they can pack more animals in the truck.",
