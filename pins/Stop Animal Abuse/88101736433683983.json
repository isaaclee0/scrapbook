      "description": "This beautiful dog is a mother dog who was used as an \"incubator\" to get pregnant over and over again in a puppy mill. Puppy mills are just like feed mills. Places where feed is made. Except they use live animals who live in cages, get no veterinary care and are fed poor quality food to keep reproducing so they can sell the puppies.
