      "description": "Please repin.  These are PUPPIES, crammed into a cage so small, they can't move.  They will EXIST this way until sold at MEAT MARKET.  There are 11 countries in which dogs and cats are eaten, and (most notably) in Korea and China, they are brutally tortured before killing, in the belief that adrenaline released during extreme torture \"flavors\" the meat and adds to a man's sexual prowess.  This happens to millions of dogs and cats every year.  PLEASE help them.",
