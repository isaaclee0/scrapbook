      "description": "It's a sound not easily forgotten. Just before dawn, a 4-year-old elephant bellows as 7 village men stab nails into her ears and feet. She is tied up and immobilized in a small, wooden cage. The cage is called a \"training crush.\" It's the centerpiece of a centuries-old ritual in northern Thailand designed to domesticate young elephants. In addition to beatings, handlers use sleep-deprivation, hunger, and thirst to \"break\" the elephants' spirit and make them submissive to their owners.",
