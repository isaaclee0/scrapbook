      "description": "Hog-Dog fighting may come as a new phenomenon to some, however it is a violent sport in which a hog and a dog are forced to fight as a means of entertainment. The dogs, most commonly pit bulls, are trained to attack whatever animal they are put against, in this case an innocent hog. Usually the hog has had its tusks removed with bolt cutters to remove any chance it has of defending itself against the trained and angry dog.",
