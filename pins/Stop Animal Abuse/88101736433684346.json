      "description": "$1000 Reward~Justice Rescue. 2 pit bull pups arrived at Conchester Animal Hosp Dec 21, by a man & woman wearing surgical gloves. The cut on the 3-wk pup was a deep, thin slice down to the chest cavity-the couple admitted it was part of pain-conditioning to prepare the puppy for dog fighting-they couldn't afford vets costs so would \"throw them somewhere.\" Michele Lord followed them & pleaded to let her adopt the puppies.She got the male but they kept the other pup. CALL:215-942-6363 WITH ANY INFO",
