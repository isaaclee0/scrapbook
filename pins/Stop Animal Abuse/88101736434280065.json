They are then returned to their cages until they are ready to be plucked again. 🍂🍃 The birds are live-plucked for the first time at about ten weeks old, and are plucked again four to six times a year until they are sent to slaughter at about four years old. (👉 Ducks and geese can live about 12 to 15 years. 👈) Others go on to be force-fed for the production of foie gras 😲💀 There is such a thing as \"natural drop feathers\" but I find their origins dubious and I will not wear them. ✴ To me, wearing \"cruelty free\" feathers is the same as wearing vintage fur, It perpetuates the myth that it's okay to use animals and that wearing feathers is cool. Feathers are not cool. They're incredibly cruel. Fake for the animal's sake! #vegansofig\"",
