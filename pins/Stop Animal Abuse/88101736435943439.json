      "description": "HALAL is s a barbaric and cruel method of animal slaughter that involves facing the animal towards Mecca, cutting it's throat, and letting it bleed to death while still conscious.  Ohio, Michigan, and other states buy Halal meat with taxpayer money for schools, prisons, and other institutions to appease organizations like CAIR. They are also supporting animal cruelty, and in some cases, indirectly funding terrorism. ---",
