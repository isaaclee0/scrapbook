      "description": "Bear baiting still persists in regions of northern Pakistan. Bear baiting events are for entertainment. A bear is tethered to a post with a rope or chain. The bearâ€™s claws have been blunted, his canine teeth removed and a nose ring inserted. At least two dogs are then let loose to attack the bear. The dogs are removed when the bear submits; this is seen when the bear rolls on the ground to avoid further attack by the dogs. The bear is forced to do this up to as much as ten times",
