Their vocal cords are mutilated to not scream of fear when the bulls approach them or of suffering when they encornent. So the public does not realize when animals suffer. When the Bullfight starts, horses were blindfolded, Vaseline and cotton in the ears and nostrils, depriving them of their senses.",
