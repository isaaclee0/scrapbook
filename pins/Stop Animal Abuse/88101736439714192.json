They put wooden or plastic blocks in their mouth which cause them to starve or die or dehydration..!!!!! the greyhounds owner (they use them for hunting) have the rights to put them to death if they didn't do a good hunting season.They starve them,hung them slowly,put them in holes,in a black room without food or water,shoot at them,tie them to a car.Tens of thousands die each year in horrific conditions.... =( soo sad.",
