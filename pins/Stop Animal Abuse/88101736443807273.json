Slaughter houses are places of death and destruction, abuse is rife by twisted callous people who KILL for a living, just because YOU personally do not kill these animals does not mean you are not guilty.  Paying someone else to KILL the flesh you eat is wrong...  YOU can make a difference NOW  Go vegan and save 95 LIVES per year",
