      "description": "Brick Donkeys Worked to Death in Nepal Countless working equines face unspeakable abuse in Nepal's brick factories. While carrying bricks to and fro the kilns, equines are overloaded, overworked and continuously beaten. Most are made to work till they drop, literally. It has been in the forefront of a movement to promote 'clean and green bricks' instead of 'blood bricks' causing severe environmental damage while being produced at the expense of donkeys, as well as child workers.",
