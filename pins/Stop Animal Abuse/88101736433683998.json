      "description": "The perception is “the animal wasn’t killed”. But these products are intertwined with factory farming. Goose and ducks used for down production are plucked alive – 4 to 5 times in their short lives. The birds legs are held between the legs of the “Ripper,” person who removes feathers. The birds struggle and break limbs trying to get away. Geese normally live in small family units and mate for life. The average life span of a goose is 20 years but “commercial” geese live 4–5 years.",
