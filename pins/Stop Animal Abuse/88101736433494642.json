      "description": "The Vancouver Humane Society is urging the Calgary Stampede to drop calf-roping from its rodeo program.  It’s a cruel event in which terrified calves as young as three months old are chased, roped to a sudden halt and thrown to the ground.  We’re asking the public to let the Stampede know that this is unacceptable.    The elimination of calf-roping would be a huge step in the right direction, one we believe would be welcomed by millions of Canadians.  If you agree, please click on pic to sign!",
