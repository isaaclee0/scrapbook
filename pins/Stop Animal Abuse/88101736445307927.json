Elephants beaten w/bullhooks, shocked w/ electric prods, big cats dragged by heavy chains around their neck  hit w/ sticks, bears hit w/ long poles  chimpanzees kicked  hit with riding crops. Trainers must break their spirit; they have to tear the animal down psychologically before they  can actually teach them tricks. Training is done when the elephant is just a baby.",
