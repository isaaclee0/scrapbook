      "description": "All puppies at pet stores come from puppy mills.They came from a puppy mill! From a mother dog like the one in the picture, they live in terrible, disgusting conditions, and they are forced to produce puppies as many times as they can. Once the mother dog cannot produce anymore puppies, she is killed or thrown away like garbage. These poor sentient beings are treated as if they are just money making machines. Be a friend to the animals, adopt don't shop!!",
