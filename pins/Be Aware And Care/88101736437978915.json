      "description": "Bangladesh    There is no room for complacency when 215 million children are still labouring to survive and  more than half of these are exposed to the worst forms of child labour, including slavery and  involvement in armed conflict. We cannot allow the eradication of child labour  to slip down the development agenda â€” all countries should be striving to  achieve this target, individually and collectively.  - Juan Somavia    Steve McCurry's Blog",
