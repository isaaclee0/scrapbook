      "description": "Iran... What A difference three decades make. How very demeaning to those women that they cannot show their faces and be considered human. They look like pieces of furniture with no say and no opinions, just existing. The men are told to take care of the women because they are nothing more than livestock or domestic animals. This picture shows how Iran has slipped back to the Middle Ages since the Muslims took over. This could be us (USA) in the near future.",
