      "description": "Becoming a Slavery-Free Business: Removing Slavery from Product Supply Chains by Free the Slaves. There’s slavery in every shopping mall in America. From cocoa, coffee and clothing, to cars, computers and cell phones—many products sold in the U.S. are tainted by slavery. Sometimes it’s sweatshop slavery where goods are manufactured.
