      "description": "Melissa Woodward is a victim of human trafficking who is now driven to give her pain a purpose. Beginning at the age of 12, Woodward was sold into a sex trafficking ring by a relative and was subjected to unspeakable abuse every night. After years of struggle and perseverance, the now 35-year-old mother of three is on a mission to bring domestic sex trafficking to the forefront of people's minds, in order to save a forgotten group of children who are living lives that many deny even exist.",
