      "description": "This song says so much and well it's just so true, \"what if your blessings come through raindrops, healing through tears and 1000 sleepless nights are what it takes to know you're near. What if trials of this life are your mercies in disguise\" God has been playing this on my heart a lot lately... and well it's comforting to know this. God gives us a lot of gifts in disguise through various forms or sadness.",
