      "description": "If our lights are going to be seen by the “world”, then we must be involved in the world, not isolated from it. We need to be up close and personal; visible.  We are to remain “unpolluted by the world” but the place we belong is “in the world”, right in the middle of it, involved everyday with people who need to see the light of Jesus in us.   Matthew 5:16 ~ In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.",
