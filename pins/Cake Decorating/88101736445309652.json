      "description": "Chocolate Frosting 1/2 cup butter, room temperature 8 ounces cream cheese, room temperature 1/2 cup baking cocoa 1 teaspoon vanilla 4 cups powdered sugar Place butter and cream cheese in a mixing bowl beat until combined about 1 minute. Scape down the sides and add cocoa and vanilla mix until combined. Add powdered sugar and mix until well combined. I beat for a couple of minutes. I think the texture is lighter if you beat for a few minutes. Frost cake and enjoy!",
