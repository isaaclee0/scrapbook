As parents we often don't want to hear the crying or yelling and we try and get our kids to stop them...We can teach kids to express their emotions in different ways (like using their words), but first we need to acknowledge their emotions. We can't teach kids anything when they've shut down and don't feel like anyone is listening to them.",
