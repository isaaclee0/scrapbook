      "description": "I was not your typical first-time mom. Everything went wrong from the first day of motherhood. I couldn't quiet my baby, I was bad at nursing, and I found myself getting angry at my baby. I felt like I was completely and utterly failing at what I thought was my life's calling. If you feel this way, you are not alone.",
