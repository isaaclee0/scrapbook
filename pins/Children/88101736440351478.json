      "description": "Bedtime is often a time when worries or fear show up in our children. If you have walked through seasons of bad dreams and restless nights, consider adding a new task to your bedtime routine. Read and meditate on (or think about) Scripture as a family. Also consider speaking a bedtime blessing over your kids before they fall asleep.",
