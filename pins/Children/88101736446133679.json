Make up your own: \"Whisper voice\" instead of stop yelling. \"Mommy's listening\" for the whining times. \"Love time\" as a break when child is upset, fussy or clinging (then give your child attention and cuddles). Teach respect and proper communication techniques. Remember to keep your patience too :)",
