Such as-fixing a collar, a pat on shoulder, a simple hug. 2) Each day children need one meaningful eye-to-eye conversation with a parent.  3) 9 minutes for greatest impact on a child: the first 3 minutes–right after they wake up the 3 minutes after they come home from school, and the last 3 minutes of the day, before they go to bed.",
