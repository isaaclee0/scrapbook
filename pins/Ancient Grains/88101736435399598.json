      "description": "Barley has been a part of manâ€™s diet for more than 12,000 years. In the past, barley was cultivated not only for as a source of nourishment, but also for its therapeutic qualities. Romans drank barley tea to help regulate intestinal function. It was one of the most common remedies of Hippocrates, the father of medicine.",
