      "description": "On one hand, having a pet door installed means you don't have to wake up at the crack of dawn to let your dog or cat out. But on the other hand, it also gives your pet access to a possibly wet and muddy yard whenever they want. Which is why the Petwalk automatic pet door can be programmed to only open during specific hours, and even keep your dog or cat indoors when it detects rain.",
