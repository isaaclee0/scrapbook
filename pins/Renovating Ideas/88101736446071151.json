      "description": "An economical and clever storage solution which transforms the unused space under your patio into a sturdy and functional drawer. Easily harmonized: cover its exterior with the same covering as your deck and it blends into your decor. Supports a spread out load up to 250 pounds, it can store numerous articles: umbrellas, tires, toys, pool chemicals & accessories... Easy to open and close (even for a child) due to the ball-bearing slides and a metal handle (lockable)",
