      "description": "Epoxy putty is expensive, so when you run into deep holes or large areas to fill, start by filling most of the repair with wood. Cut a piece that's small enough to allow a layer of epoxy over the top. Then adhere it by pressing it into a bed of epoxy putty. You don't have to wait for this epoxy to set. You can finish the repair with more epoxy putty right away.",
