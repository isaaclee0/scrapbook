While in the camp, Pilecki organized a resistance movement and as early as 1941, informed the Western Allies of Nazi Germany's Auschwitz atrocities. He escaped in 1943 and took part in the Warsaw Uprising. He remained loyal to the Polish government-in-exile and was executed in 1948 by the Stalinist secret police on charges of working for \"foreign imperialism\".",
