      "description": "This soldier, stationed in Iraq asked his wife to send him dirt (U.S. soil), fertilizer, and some grass seed so that he can have the sweet aroma, and feel the grass grow beneath his feet. When the men of the squadron have a mission that they are going on, they take turns walking through the grass and the American soil â€” to bring them good luck. Of all the things he could have asked his wife to send to him from home...he asked for American soil.",
