      "description": "Witold Pilecki - To prove that Auschwitz was killing people, not a labor camp, forged papers,entered a ghetto roundup, and was sent to Auschwitz. He redistributed food to prisoners, trained them in martial arts, and passed news out. He & a few others beat up guards, stole their clothes and left the camp carrying the guard's stolen papers. They were in the woods for 3 days, til they met up with the Home Army and passed the info on. This was the first  evidence of the existence of death camps.",
