      "description": "Jan Kostanski, a Polish teenager, assisted the Wierzbickis, a Jewish family he knew well as neighbors before the war. After German authorities confined the Wierzbickis in the Warsaw ghetto, Kostanski smuggled food to them.  In this 1942 photo, Jan is entering the ghetto through a barbed-wire fence. When the Germans began deportations from the ghetto, Jan helped bring several members of the Wierzbicki family to safety on the “Aryan” side of Warsaw, where his mother found them hiding places.",
