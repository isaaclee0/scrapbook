I wasn’t going to let that stop me.. I joined for my family.. for my friends..for the people I know.. and for the people I don’t.. Now, no one wants to see me.. no one wants to look at me.. and no one wants to know me..”  Let anyone you know in the military, that we love and respect them so very much...Please never forget them!",
