My assistance to Jews was rooted in my Christian world outlook… It was basically a question of saving human lives threatened with death. How could I then seriously consider bureaucratic schemes and calculations? \" Paul Grüninger, Swiss border policeman who illegally allowed 3,600 desperate Jews entry to Switzerland. Lost his job and pension, died in poverty.",
