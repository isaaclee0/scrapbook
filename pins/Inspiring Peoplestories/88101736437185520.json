      "description": "Mid-1930s, an Australian journalist visited Germany to report on the rise of fascism and interview Adolf Hitler. The atrocities she saw there, which included the public beating of Jews, forever changed the course of her young life. Nancy Wake, who died Sunday Aug 7, 2011 at age 98, would spend World War II fighting Nazism tooth & nail, saving thousands of Allied lives, winding up at the top of the Gestapoâ€™s most-wanted list & ultimately receiving more decorations than any other servicewoman.",
