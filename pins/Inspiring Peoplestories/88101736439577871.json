      "description": "Anna Essinger was a German-Jewish educator. At the age of 20, she encountered Quakers and was greatly influenced by their attitudes. In 1933, with the Nazi threat looming and the permission of all the parents, she moved the school and its 66 children, mostly Jewish, to safety in England. During the war, Essinger established a reception camp for 10,000 German children sent to England on the Kindertransports. After the war, her school took many child survivors of Nazi concentration camps.",
