      "description": "Ayam kecap pedas is an Indonesian take on Chinese chicken in ginger and soy sauce. In this Indonesian version, the sauce is made with kecap manis (Indonesian sweet soy sauce) and the spice paste is a mix of chili, ginger, shallot, garlic, and candlenut. The taste is distinctly Indonesian, and once reduced, the sauce gives a nice glossy glace to coat the chicken, and they are especially good eaten with steamed white rice. â™¥",
