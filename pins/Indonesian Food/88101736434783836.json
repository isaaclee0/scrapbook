      "description": "DAGING BUMBU BALI - Indonesian meat-dish from Food.com: I have cooked this dish for more then 25 years and the only thing I have changed about it is that I don't eat it on the day I cook it. I put it in the fridge for up to 2 days or freeze it, (leaving the leaves in), until I need it. This has two reasons, the flavors improve and as the cook I find you can enjoy it more because the smell of the spices, when cooking lessens your appetite.",
