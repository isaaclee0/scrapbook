      "description": "Mie goreng is a delicious and traditional dish of fried noodles found throughout Indonesia. A good mie goreng is equal parts sweet, salty, and umami, and packed with fresh vegetables and tender chicken and/or shrimp. And between the chewy noodles, fried shallots, crunchy bean sprouts, scrambled eggs, and succulent proteins, there are lots of interesting textures going on in each bite. There are very few (if any?) noodle dishes I love more than this one. Try this mie goreng recipe today!",
