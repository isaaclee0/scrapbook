      "description": "I was born in Medan, the capital city of North Sumatra, and spent my childhood there. It is quite natural then that I am really partial to dishes from Medan. :D One such example is soto medan, chicken soup cooked in a broth of coconut milk, and believe it or not, we just call it soto back then since no one would get confused as to which soto you meant.",
