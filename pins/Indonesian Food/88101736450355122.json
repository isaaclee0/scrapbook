      "description": "As promised, here is another recipe using the super versatile sambal goreng. If you are interested at preparing a multi purpose sauce that can be used in many dishes, you should check the recipe out. Today I am using fish for this recipe, but you can also use other seafood, like shrimps, squids, even crabs, or make a seafood combo dish. Lately I develop an allergic reaction to shellfish, so I am sticking to fish, but I actually love this dish with shrimps.",
