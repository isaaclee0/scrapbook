      "description": "For many Indonesians, tempeh is almost always fried one way or another. This recipe for fried tempeh with chili sauce is slightly more advance than a simple pan-frying, but it is using simple ingredients, and the extra effort is worth it. You will end up with crispy and crunchy tempeh, with a savory, sweet, sour, and spicy glace in every bite.",
