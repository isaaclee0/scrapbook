When pruning peach trees, the shape of your hand is very similar to the shape of the pruned peach tree. The center is open with about 5 main branches angling upward at 45 degrees. Of course, unlike your hand, the branches are evenly spaced around the tree.  Each one of these main branches holds another hand. This second hand is what carries and bears fruit.",
