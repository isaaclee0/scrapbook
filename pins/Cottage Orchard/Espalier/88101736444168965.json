      "description": "In winter plant the one-year-old, one-metre high, single-stemmed apples at 45 degrees, about 1.5 metres apart. Tie them on to the wire. The picture, above, taken in France, shows apples planted straight, not at 45 degrees. Bob says the angled planting works better.  4.In summer prune the upward growing growth back to a stub. These stubs will become fruiting spurs.  5.The trees will flower in the spring, develop their fruit over summer and be ready to harvest in late autumn",
