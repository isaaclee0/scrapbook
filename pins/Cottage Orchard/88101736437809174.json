      "description": "Cold Hardy Avocado,This Cold Hardy variety is the most popular variety because they are heavy producers... easily grownâ€¦ and produce delicious fruit. If you grow your tree in a container, it will stay about 5-7 feet tall. Small enough to move indoors and big enough to give you a lot of fruit. Trees planted outdoors grow from 20-30 feet tall. A commercial orchard tree can produce 1,200 avocados annually.",
