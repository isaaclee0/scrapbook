      "description": "How to Prune a Blueberry Bush. My summary: Keep 6-12 canes (Main shoots growing from the base) Berries produced on one year old shoots Pruning at bottom: Remove low branches Cut as close to ground as can No canes older than 6 years old, best canes are 3-6 years old Pruning at top: Remove weaker branches or shoots or branches not supporting healthy shoots. Swollen buds at top of stem are this yearâ€™s crop. Smaller pointed buds are leaf buds. Prune 50-75% of bush Should take about 10 minutes.",
