      "description": "Raised Box for Blueberries Blueberries and cranberries get their own raised boxes, as they require special acidic soil. The Whites can treat the soil successfully in these raised beds, resulting in a bountiful harvest, difficult in most northern Illinois soil. Throughout the season, Judy practices rotation planting, which means as some plants finish their harvest, she pulls them out and puts something else in their place.",
