      "description": "How to grow watermelons: They do not like \"wet feet\" but need water each week. You can trellis up watermelon plants & once they set fruit, support the burgeoning melons with slings made from cheesecloth, nylon stockings, or old T-shirts. If the sling completely covers the fruit, it provides protection from insects. In addition to saving space, trellising improves air circulation and helps prevent disease. | The Micro Gardener",
