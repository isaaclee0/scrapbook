      "description": "Fire Blight Symptoms Now Visible  Fire blight is the most important disease of apple and pear in Kentucky. Symptoms have begun to appear throughout the Commonwealth; however, initial infections occurred at bloom. The pathogen survives winter in dead, dying, and diseased wood and in cankers. Removal of these pathogen sources can reduce spread of fire blight and should be completed in late winter while the pathogen is dormant.",
