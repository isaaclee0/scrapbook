      "description": "I’ll admit, growing mushrooms can get complicated… but it doesn’t have to be that way.  Sometimes it can be dirt simple- and that’s why I love the 5 gallon bucket method.  +It requires no special skills or previous experience. +It requires no expensive and specialized equipment. +It can produce a metric whack-ton of fresh mushrooms at home, with little effort.  So… are you ready to grow lots of fresh mushrooms at home?  Me too.  Let’s get started!",
