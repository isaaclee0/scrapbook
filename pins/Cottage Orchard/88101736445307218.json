      "description": "The members of the Fruit Tree Guild support the fruit tree in numerous ways: by luring beneficial insects for pollination, boosting soil tilth & fertility, reducing root competition, conserving water, balancing fungal population to counter disease, diversifying the yield of food, creating habitat, & several other functions. The result is a healthier tree & a varied ecology. Also, this biological support replaces human intervention, shifting the gardenerâ€™s workload onto the broad back of nature.",
