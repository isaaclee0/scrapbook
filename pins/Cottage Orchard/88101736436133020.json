      "description": "Growing grapes? Learn to prune them properly: Grapes produce the most fruit on shoots growing off of one-year-old canes. If you have too many old canes (from no pruning), then youâ€™ll get fewer grapes. If you prune back your vines completely each year, then you get lots of new growth, but again, few grapes. Learn the best practices from the National Gardening Association.",
