      "description": "Gooseberry 'Captivator' The fruits of the gooseberry (Ribes uva-crispa ‘Captivator’) have a delicious flavour so they are perfect for eating fresh, they are not often available in the greengrocer's. Great for home cultivation! Especially when you know that this particular variety has almost thornless branches! Ribes uva-crispa 'Captivator' has purplish-red berries and comes highly recommended. Height supplied 10-15 cm.",
