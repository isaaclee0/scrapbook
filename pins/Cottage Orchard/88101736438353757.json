      "description": "GOWING BERRIES AND ASPARAGUS IN THE SAME RAISED BED? I NEVER KNEW! A raised bed isolates the perennial crop from invasive weeds and grasses. Wind-blown seeds can get into the soil, of course, but the real enemies for these crops are grasses and weeds that creep into the plantings. Berries and asparagus have shallow roots that don't compete well with weeds and can be damaged by aggressive weeding tools",
