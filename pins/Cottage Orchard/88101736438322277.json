      "description": "Seaberry is a native to frightfully cold North Eurasia (primarily Russia) and can survive temperatures down to -40 degrees!  Caring for Seaberry is as easy as putting it into the ground and pruning annually to prevent it from forming a dense thicket.  The tart berries taste like a highly-concentrated orange.  They are high in vitamin C, W and essential amino acids, making them a better medicine than food source.",
