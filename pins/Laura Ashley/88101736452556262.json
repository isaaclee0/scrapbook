      "description": "Investing in a quality sofa is one of the most important purchases a home owner can make, that’s why it’s so important to get it right the first time. Unlike home decor, your lounge is something that will be a fixture in your home for decades—which is why it’s important to think about the style, size and of course the comfort of your sofa before making any big purchase. It’s also important to factor in your lifestyle and how the couch will function for the whole of the family.",
