The other two skips provide a poly-tunnel greenhouse (also insulated on the inside, since all that steel gets cold), and a shaded wormery with a comfrey bed. The wormery receives vegetable waste from local restaurants, which forms the only material input to the site now it is up and running, and provides nutrient- and microbiologically rich vermicompost. - Skip Garden in King's Cross, London",
