      "description": "Any bottle of wine you drank recently would work fine for such project. Although I recommend you to choose unusual and good looking bottles. From them you can make really cool looking lamps.  To make the lamp you need to clean your bottle and allow it to dry. Next, you need to drill a hole for a power cable near the bottom of the bottle using diamond head bit. Sand the edges of the hole and clean the bottle. Put the christmas lights in the bottle and youâ€™re done",
