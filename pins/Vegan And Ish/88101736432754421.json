I haven't tried it, and I know it's a \"processed\" food, but it seems perfect for those who are struggling with the transition to a plant based diet. It's GMO free too! Biz Stone, one of the founders of Twitter (he's vegan!) said “My first reaction was, if I was given this in a restaurant, I’d get the waiter to come over and ask if he’d accidentally given us real chicken.\" xoxo My Vegan Journal",
