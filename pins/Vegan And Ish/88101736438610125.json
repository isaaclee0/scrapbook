      "description": "Vegan Artichoke Dip -- sooo good!!! I added an extra tablespoon of nutritional yeast, as I didn't have any vegan cheese shreds on hand. I also used pickled and jarred jalapenos, to make things easier. I put the whole shebang in the food processor, which made it super easy and quick. The whole pan got eaten, and I found a new go-to recipe to use when our vegan friends visit!-- NW",
