      "description": "I can hear you skeptics now.  Smoked wheat gluten?  Believe it, people. This stuff looks and tastes like Texas brisket – or as close as a vegetarian version can come, anyway.  With a nice crusty exterior, it’s even got the “burnt ends” of authentic barbecue. At a 4th of July party, the guests – including meat eaters – were practically clawing at each other to eat the seitan, even before it hit the table.",
