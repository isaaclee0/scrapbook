      "description": "Truffled Cashew Cheese (or as I like to call it 'crack cheese').  Yep, it's tasty stuff - fancy it up with a drizzle of truffle oil, or more earthy with some fresh herbs.  Use raw for a spread for breads, crackers, crudite - or use to layer in vegan lasagna, baked pasta shells, or a base for pizza.  Ready to make it yet?  Go soak those cashews, then! :)  Recipe from my newest cookbook \"Let Them Eat Vegan\".",
