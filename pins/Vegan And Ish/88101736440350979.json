      "description": "This pie … is so amazing. It’s probably one of my best creations to date. And you know that I make A LOT of raw desserts, right? :) I first tried it in Bangkok, in a raw vegan restaurant called Rasayana Retreat (I really recommend going there if you are in Bangkok!). And since my first bite I just knew that I’ll want to recreate it as soon as possible. So when we came back from Thailand I immediately went to work. | http://shinewithnature.com/raw-banoffee-pie/",
