      "description": "Produce On Parade – A Modern Way To Eat Cookbook Review + The Very Hungry Burger Recipe -This is a quick burger recipe that comes together in a snap! It’s heavy on umami thanks to baby portobello mushrooms, soy sauce, and tahini. Chickpeas, quinoa, oats, and brown rice lend a substantial amount of protein, while fresh herbs and lemon zest cut through for a bright profile. It’s a well-rounded, completely terrific everyday burger.",
