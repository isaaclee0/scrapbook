      "description": "Well, in spite of my having seen my Greek Cypriot father prepare kleftiko many times in his restaurants, my vegan version thankfully involves no animal cruelty, yet contains all the essence of pleasure to be found in this iconic Greek dish.  And, by the way, many other similar dishes can be found in my recent book ‘YASOU’, which is full of Greek and Middle Eastern vegan delights !",
