      "description": "I always make these potatoes at holiday time for big dinners.  They are easy to make: Just mash potatoes plain with vegan butter or you can add yummy ingredients like cheese, parsley, green onion etc.  Stuff in to a greased muffin tin, run a fork along the top and brush with melted butter or olive oil.  Bake at 375 degrees or until tops are crispy and golden.  These are always a family fave in my house!!",
