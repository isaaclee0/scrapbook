      "description": "Baked Barbecue Panko Tofu --This was truly GREAT! Crunchy and delicious without the mushy tofu texture. BUT a few notes:  (1) I cheated. The recipe includes homemade BBQ sauce. I used store bought. (2) Be sure to use a THICK coat of sauce before you coat them in breading for full flavor. (3) I would decrease the salt (or cut it out completely). (4) Serve with additional BBQ for dipping.",
