Hinting, joking, using sarcasm, denial of anger (they're always angry), playing mind games, manipulating, gossiping, but not confronting, being late repeatedly, procrastinating, sulking, pouting, withdrawing, sabotaging, doing a sloppy job, not sharing the honest truth when asked, etc.! Try to communicate in a clear, direct, calm, respectful way instead of any of these ways!! It's so important!",
