      "description": "\"As I held her hand and saw mortal life drain from her fingers, I confess I was overcome. Before I married her, she had been the girl of my dreams, to use the words of a song then popular. She was my dear companion for more than two-thirds of a century, my equal before the lord - really, my superior. And now in my old age, she has again become the girl of my dreams.\" [President Gordon B. Hinckley about his wife, Marjorie] <3",
