      "description": "Everyone’s tempted, right? Husbands . . . wives . . . even Jesus was tempted in the same way we are tempted, the Bible says.  It isn’t sinful to struggle against temptation. It is, however, sinful to yield. And, we don’t have to yield. We choose to yield to temptation . . . because our flesh loves filth. We’re going to have to reconcile ourselves to that fact. Should your spouse trust you? Can your spouse trust you? Is trust a foundation stone of your marriage? MatthewLJacobson.com",
