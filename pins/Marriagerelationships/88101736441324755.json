      "description": "Negative emotions like anger and frustration can wreak havoc on your marriage. It's easy to feel justified because you were disappointed or hurt or betrayed and yet...Holding onto that anger does nothing for you. It doesn't make the situation better. It doesn't bring the two of you together. It just creates distance. If you know it's time for you to let go of something that has been making you angry. #anger #Letitgo #negative #positive #marriage #realworld #relationships #takeaction",
