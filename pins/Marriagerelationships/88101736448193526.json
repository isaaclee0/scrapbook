      "description": "There’s no shame in a wife not wanting to be intimate with her husband if he’s offended her by either his words or actions. However, it’s not wise for a wife to stay in that place in her relationship, otherwise more problems will ensue.  You’ve got to learn how to move forward and reconcile with one another so your marriage can thrive.",
