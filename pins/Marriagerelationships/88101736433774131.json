      "description": "I could not believe the spiteful verbal assault being lashed out at me.  Fear, anger, and bitterness began to consume me â€¦ my emotions were in such turmoil. As I glanced in the car mirror at my swollen eyes, and flushed red cheeks, the words began to replay in my mind over and over again and choke out any positive thought I had of my husband and I restoring our marriage.  I felt completely abandoned and alone and began to have a total meltdown.",
