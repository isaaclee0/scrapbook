      "description": "When I judge a man for marriage, I mentally take away his looks, his money, his cars and everything materialistic, and then ask myself what he really has to offer. Is he honest? Loyal? Caring and kind? Loving and trustworthy? Because let me tell you, while his good lucks and money will make you weak in the knees now, at 3am when your child is screaming to be fed, and your eyes are heavy, and you body weak from postpartum, it will not be how he looks or all that he owns that will",
