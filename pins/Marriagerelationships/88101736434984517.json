      "description": "Are you flirting with the world? Are you cheating on God? Sounds like the questions are getting even tougher today. But this is not just about motivation any more. First unthinkable becomes thinkable, then suddenly it's doable. Slowly worldly things creep up on us. Are you all for God? Or do you still play the field? Do you suppose God doesn't care? This is a spiritual form of adultery we are talking about here! www.flowingfaith.com/2011/08/flirting-with-the-world.html",
