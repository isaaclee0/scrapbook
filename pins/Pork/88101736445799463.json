Pork & pork jelly set in a simple hot water crust.Served cold as either a snack or as part of a meal.Two well-known versions: the first being the classic which uses minced & cured pork,which retains its lovely pink color when cooked.It's also cooked in a mold or pork pie dish so that the straight-sided silhouette can be achieved.The  Melton Mowbray pork pie,uses uncured pork as well as a hand-formed crust. Alongside your pie would be a bottle of HP sauce, mustards, pickles & chutneys.",
