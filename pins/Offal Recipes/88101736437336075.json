I skipped the blueberry jelly part and instead used 2 cups of blueberries and extra cinnamon in the pate portion...didn't have thyme on hand so used tarragon. Skipped the balsamic due to food intolerance, but i'm guessing it would have been AWESOME in it.  I did soak the beef liver in lemon juice for 12 hours prior due to personal preference",
