      "description": "CHEESY ESCALLOPED CABBAGE : Serves 3-4 as a main course, 6-8 as a side ~~ This casserole makes a wonderful Vegetarian Lunch or Dinner meal. As a side, it goes well with Pork, Ham, Sausage, and Bar-B-Q'd meats. Serve it instead of a starch at dinnertime. The Cheese makes it kid-and family-friendly. Even those who claim not to like Cabbage will love this dish. ~~ Click on the pic to access the full Recipe on my Facebook Page. Please \"Friend\" me or \"Follow\" me while you're there.",
