      "description": "Makeup artist shows you how!  I’m often asked for natural makeup ideas by mature women who don’t wish to look fake or “over-done”. In this natural, mature makeup tutorial with my lovely model Susan, I share tips for lifted eyebrows, a glowing complexion and brighter eyes. This look is great for everyday makeup, and works for a radiant wedding makeup look too, and looks amazing whether you have blonde hair, brunette hair, dark hair or silver hair. I share my TOP SPF anti-age skin care tip too!",
